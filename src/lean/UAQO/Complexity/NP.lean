  The complexity class NP and NP-hardness.

  NP is the class of decision problems verifiable in polynomial time,
  or equivalently, decidable by a nondeterministic polynomial-time TM.

/-! ## The class NP -/

/-- A verifier for a decision problem -/
structure Verifier (prob : DecisionProblem) where
  /-- The verification function: takes input and certificate -/
  verify : List Bool -> List Bool -> Bool
  /-- Certificate length is polynomial in input length -/
  cert_bound : ∃ (p : Nat), ∀ x cert, verify x cert = true -> cert.length <= x.length^p + p
  /-- Soundness: if verify accepts, then x is a YES instance -/
  sound : ∀ x cert, verify x cert = true -> x ∈ prob.yes_instances
  /-- Completeness: if x is a YES instance, some certificate works -/
  complete : ∀ x, x ∈ prob.yes_instances -> ∃ cert, verify x cert = true

/-- A problem is in NP if it has a polynomial-time verifier -/
def InNP (prob : DecisionProblem) : Prop :=
  ∃ (v : Verifier prob), True

/-- The 3-SAT decision problem -/
def ThreeSAT : DecisionProblem where
  yes_instances := { encoded | ∃ (f : CNFFormula),
    -- encoded represents f
    is_kCNF 3 f ∧ isSatisfiable f }

/-- 3-SAT is in NP (existence of verifier) -/
theorem threeSAT_in_NP : InNP ThreeSAT := by
  use {
    verify := fun _ _ => sorry  -- Actual verification logic would decode and check
    cert_bound := by
      use 1
      intro x cert _
      sorry
    sound := by
      intro x cert h
      sorry
    complete := by
      intro x hx
      sorry
  }

/-! ## NP-hardness -/

/-- A problem is NP-hard if every NP problem reduces to it -/
def IsNPHard (prob : DecisionProblem) : Prop :=
  ∀ (other : DecisionProblem), InNP other -> KarpReduction other prob

/-- A problem is NP-complete if it's both in NP and NP-hard -/
def IsNPComplete (prob : DecisionProblem) : Prop :=
  InNP prob ∧ IsNPHard prob

/-- 3-SAT is NP-complete (Cook-Levin theorem) -/
axiom threeSAT_NP_complete : IsNPComplete ThreeSAT

/-! ## Alternative characterization via polynomial hierarchy -/

/-- P ⊆ NP -/
theorem P_subset_NP (prob : DecisionProblem) (h : InP prob) : InNP prob := by
  rcases h with ⟨decide, _, hdecide⟩
  use {
    verify := fun x _ => decide x
    cert_bound := by
      use 1
      intro x cert _
      -- The verify function ignores cert, so any accepted cert works
      -- We just need cert.length <= x.length^1 + 1, which holds since
      -- in the complete case we use [] which has length 0
      sorry
    sound := by
      intro x cert h
      exact (hdecide x).mp h
    complete := by
      intro x hx
      use []
      exact (hdecide x).mpr hx
  }

/-- If P = NP, then NP-complete problems are in P -/
theorem P_eq_NP_implies (prob : DecisionProblem) (hNPC : IsNPComplete prob)
    (hPeqNP : ∀ p, InNP p -> InP p) : InP prob :=
  hPeqNP prob hNPC.1
