# Experiments

New ideas, explorations, and rough drafts extending the published work on adiabatic quantum optimization.


## Purpose

This directory is a staging area for content that is not yet ready for `src/chapters/`. Ideas are developed here before they mature into formal thesis sections.

The thesis is built on a single published paper (`paper/`). This directory is where we go beyond it. The paper establishes the foundation. The experiments here aim to extend that foundation with new contributions: generalizations, alternative approaches, open questions pursued further. A thesis that merely explains existing work is a report. A thesis that advances it is a contribution.


## Structure

Each experiment lives in a numbered directory `0x_name/` with standardized contents:

```
0x_experiment_name/
├── main.md              # Overview: problem, conjectures, status, references
├── proof.md             # Full mathematical proof (the main deliverable)
├── lib/                 # Supporting code (Python, numerical experiments)
│   ├── *.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── lean/                # Formal verification (Lean 4 + Mathlib)
│   ├── lakefile.lean
│   ├── lean-toolchain
│   └── ExperimentName/
│       ├── Basic.lean
│       └── *.lean
└── notes/               # Working notes, literature, scratchpad
    └── *.md
```

**File purposes**:
- `main.md`: Overview - problem statement, conjectures, approach, status, references. Navigable summary.
- `proof.md`: The actual work - full theorems with complete proofs. This becomes the thesis chapter.
- `lib/`: Numerical validation, computational experiments, figures
- `lean/`: End-to-end complete formal verification (optional)
- `notes/`: Literature surveys, failed attempts, scratchpad, intermediate drafts


## Guidelines

Work here is expected to be rough. The goal is exploration rather than polish. However:
- Notation should align with the published paper to ease later integration.
- Claims should be clearly labeled as CONJECTURE, THEOREM (with proof), or EMPIRICAL.
- Failed attempts are valuable and should be documented honestly.
- Literature surveys should verify novelty before deep investment.

When an experiment matures sufficiently, extract the relevant content into the appropriate chapter file and archive the experiment with a note.

## Templates

### main.md (Overview)

```markdown
# [Experiment Name]

## Problem Statement
What question are we trying to answer?

## Why Novel
What existing work is related? What gap does this fill?

## Conjectures
State precise mathematical claims to prove/disprove.

## Approach
Strategy for attacking the problem.

## Status
Current state: Proposed / Exploratory / Complete

## References
Related papers and prior work.
```

### proof.md (The Work)

No template. Write the mathematics as it develops. The structure emerges from the content.

This is the main deliverable - what eventually becomes a thesis chapter.

Needs to be absolutely correct, robust and complete.

## References

These papers form the basis for all experiments:

1. Original paper (`paper/`): A_1 NP-hard, optimal AQO runtime O(2^{n/2})
2. Guo-An 2025 (`citations/`): Power-law schedules, measure condition, p=3/2 optimality
