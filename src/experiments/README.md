# Experiments

New ideas, explorations, and rough drafts.

## Purpose

This directory is a staging area for content that is not yet ready for `chapters/`. Ideas are developed here before they mature into formal thesis sections.

## Guidelines

Work here is expected to be rough. The goal is exploration rather than polish. However, notation should still align with the published paper to ease later integration.

When an experiment matures sufficiently, extract the relevant content into the appropriate chapter file and remove the experiment or archive it with a note.

## Contents

Organize by topic or chapter affiliation. Use descriptive filenames that indicate the subject matter.
