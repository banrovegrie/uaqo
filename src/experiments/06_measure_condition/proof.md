# The Measure Condition: Necessity and the Scaling Spectrum


## Main Results

**Theorem 1 (Geometric Characterization)**: The measure condition holds with C independent of Delta_* if and only if the gap approaches its minimum at most linearly.

**Theorem 2 (Scaling Spectrum)**: For gap with flatness exponent alpha, the optimal runtime satisfies T = Theta(1/Delta_*^{3 - 2/alpha}).

**Corollary**: The binary dichotomy conjecture is false. Runtime exponents form a continuum in [1, 3).


## Setup

Consider adiabatic evolution with H(s) = (1-s)H_0 + sH_1, spectral gap Delta(s), minimum gap Delta_* = min_s Delta(s) at s = s*.

**Gap geometry**: Near s*, assume Delta(s) = Delta_* + c|s - s*|^alpha for constants c > 0 and alpha > 0.

**JRS Error Bound**: The adiabatic error with scheduling u: [0,1] -> [0,1] satisfies:
```
eta <= (const/T) * [boundary terms + integral (u')^2/Delta^3 ds]
```

**Power-law scheduling**: u'(s) = c_p * Delta^p(u(s)) where c_p = integral_0^1 Delta^{-p}(v) dv.


## Proof of Theorem 1

**Definition**: Gap Delta satisfies the measure condition if exists C > 0 such that mu({s : Delta(s) <= x}) <= Cx for all x > 0.

For x = Delta_* + epsilon (small epsilon > 0), the sublevel set near s* has measure:
```
mu({s : Delta(s) <= x}) = 2(epsilon/c)^{1/alpha}
```

**Case alpha <= 1**: The ratio mu/x = 2(epsilon/c)^{1/alpha}/(Delta_* + epsilon) is bounded as epsilon varies over (0, infinity). Taking C = max over all x of this ratio gives a finite constant independent of Delta_*.

**Case alpha > 1**: At x = 2*Delta_*, we need 2(Delta_*/c)^{1/alpha} <= 2C*Delta_*, which requires (Delta_*)^{1/alpha - 1} <= C*c^{1/alpha}. Since 1/alpha - 1 < 0, the LHS diverges as Delta_* -> 0. No finite C works for all Delta_*.

## Lemma (Gap Integral Bound)

For Delta(s) = Delta_* + c|s - s*|^alpha and beta > 1/alpha:
```
integral_0^1 Delta^{-beta}(s) ds = Theta(Delta_*^{1/alpha - beta})
```

**Proof**: Substituting u = c|s-s*|^alpha/Delta_* and computing the resulting integral, which converges for beta > 1/alpha.

**Verification**: For alpha = 1, this gives Theta(Delta_*^{1-beta}), matching Guo-An's Lemma 3.3 under measure condition.

## Proof of Theorem 2

With power-law scheduling, the dominant error term transforms to:
```
eta ~ (1/T) * c_p * integral Delta^{p-3} dv
```

where c_p = integral Delta^{-p} dv.

Using the Lemma:
```
c_p = Theta(Delta_*^{1/alpha - p})
integral Delta^{-(3-p)} = Theta(Delta_*^{1/alpha + p - 3})
```

Product:
```
c_p * integral Delta^{p-3} = Theta(Delta_*^{(1/alpha - p) + (1/alpha + p - 3)}) = Theta(Delta_*^{2/alpha - 3})
```

Thus eta ~ (1/T) * Delta_*^{2/alpha - 3}.

Since 2/alpha - 3 < 0 for alpha > 0, we have eta ~ Delta_*^{-(3-2/alpha)} / T.

For constant error eta = O(1): T = Omega(Delta_*^{2/alpha - 3}).

Since 2/alpha - 3 < 0 for alpha > 2/3, we can write Delta_*^{2/alpha - 3} = 1/Delta_*^{-(2/alpha - 3)} = 1/Delta_*^{3 - 2/alpha}.

Thus T = Omega(1/Delta_*^{3 - 2/alpha}).

**Verification**:
- alpha = 1: T = Omega(1/Delta_*^1) = Omega(1/Delta_*). Matches Guo-An.
- alpha = 2: T = Omega(1/Delta_*^2).
- alpha -> infinity: T -> Omega(1/Delta_*^3).

## Discussion

The measure condition captures gap geometry: V-shaped minima (alpha = 1) vs flat-bottomed minima (alpha > 1).

**Physical interpretation**: Flat minima create wider "danger zones" where Delta ~ Delta_*, forcing the adiabatic evolution to traverse slowly for longer, accumulating more error.

**Implications**: The exponent gamma = 3 - 2/alpha provides fine-grained complexity classification beyond the binary easy/hard dichotomy. The "worst case" O(1/Delta_*^2) commonly cited in literature corresponds to alpha = 2 (quartic minimum), but arbitrarily flat minima can be even worse.


## Open Questions

1. Is the lower bound T = Omega(1/Delta_*^{3-2/alpha}) achievable (matching upper bound)?
2. What is the typical alpha for random or structured Hamiltonians?
3. Is there a connection between alpha and computational complexity of the encoded problem?
