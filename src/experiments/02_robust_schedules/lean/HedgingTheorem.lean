  Hedging Theorem: Constant-Factor Approximation via Hedging Schedules

  Root module that imports all components.

  Main Result: When the crossing position is known to lie in [u_L, u_R],
  a hedging schedule achieves error ratio (u_R - u_L) compared to uniform.

  For [u_L, u_R] = [0.4, 0.8], this means 60% error reduction.
