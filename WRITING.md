# Writing Quality Rules

The thesis should read like something a curious, intelligent person would enjoy working through. Every edit should serve clarity, pleasure, and forward motion. The central danger is paper-voice leaking into thesis-voice: compressed, telegraphic, reader-hostile prose that made sense under a page limit but has no excuse here.

## Issues to Watch For

**Delimiter abuse.** Colons, semicolons, and em dashes used as load-bearing punctuation — replacing the connective thought that should link two ideas. If the clause after the delimiter could be its own sentence with a little connective work, it should be. This includes comma-spliced enumerations that pack several ideas into one line.

**Cold-start openings.** Sections or chapters that begin with formalism or bare content before giving the reader any reason to care. Every opening must first answer: why are we here, what question drives this, how does it connect to what came before.

**Bland titles.** Section or chapter titles that label a topic without making a claim or raising a question. A title should gesture at what the section does or reveals, not merely what it contains.

**Missing connective tissue.** Sections that begin and end as independent documents with no thread linking them. The end of each section should set up the next; the start of each section should pick up that thread.

**Theorem-proof deserts.** Stretches of pure formalism with no interpretive prose. After a proof, explain what the result means, what it rules out, how it fits the story.

**Unmotivated formalism.** Definitions or theorems that appear without a preceding sentence explaining in plain language what the object captures or why the result matters. The pattern should be: motivation, then formal statement, then interpretation.

**Passive pileup.** When sentence after sentence uses "it is shown that," "it can be verified that," "the following is obtained," the prose becomes lifeless. Active voice should be the default.

**False-ease phrases.** "It is easy to see," "clearly," "straightforward to verify," "the reader can check." If it is easy, show it in one line. If it is well known, cite it. If it requires work, do the work.

**Pronoun fog.** Chains of "this," "it," "which" across sentences until the antecedent is lost. Especially after displayed equations, name the referent explicitly.

**Bulk notation frontloading.** Blocks of notation or definitions at the start of a chapter before the reader needs any of them. Introduce notation in context when first needed.

**The "recall that" crutch.** Using "Recall that..." or "As discussed in Chapter X..." instead of re-establishing context naturally. Brief re-introductions are a kindness, not redundancy.

**Weak or absent closings.** Sections and chapters that stop after the last proof with no wrap-up. Every section should land its conclusion; every chapter should state what was achieved and what comes next.

**Inconsistent register.** Alternating between casual and stiff without a stable voice. Maintain one register throughout: confident, clear, approachable, never slangy, never bureaucratic.

**Missing signpost paragraphs.** Chapters should have, after the motivating opening, a roadmap paragraph telling the reader what is coming and in what order.

**Clunky cross-references.** Overuse of "as we will see in Chapter 8" or "as was shown in Section 6.3." Prefer stating the fact directly and citing parenthetically.

**Throat-clearing filler.** "It is important to note that," "it should be mentioned that," "in this section we will discuss" — these phrases add nothing and delay the actual content. Start with the content.

**Nominalization.** Turning verbs into abstract noun phrases: "we perform an analysis of" instead of "we analyze," "the application of X yields" instead of "applying X yields." Nominalization drains energy and inflates sentence length.

**Burying the lede.** Placing the key insight or punchline at the end of a long paragraph or after extensive setup, when it should be stated upfront and then justified. Lead with the result, then explain.

**Monotonous sentence structure.** Strings of sentences with the same shape, especially "We show X. We prove Y. We then establish Z." Vary sentence length, structure, and opening.

**Tense drift.** Inconsistently switching between present ("the theorem shows") and past ("we showed") when describing the same kind of result. Pick a convention and hold it.
