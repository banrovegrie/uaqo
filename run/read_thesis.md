Start completely fresh.

Your job is to read the thesis as a reader, not as an editor with a checklist. Read chapters 5 through 9 in order, start to finish, as if you picked up this document for the first time. No grep, no keyword search, no skimming section headers. Read the actual prose, sequentially, the way someone would.

After reading all five chapters, write a single document (call it reading-report.md) that answers:

The experience of reading it. Where did you get bored? Where did you lose the thread? Where did something click? Where did a transition feel jarring or a section feel like it belonged in a different chapter? Be honest and specific — cite line numbers.

The arc across chapters. Does chapter 5 set up 6? Does 6 deliver what 7 needs? Does the story from 5 through 9 feel like one argument or five separate papers stapled together? Where are the seams?

Voice and authorship. Does this read like a person wrote it — someone who spent a year inside this problem? Or does it read like a capable machine smoothed every sentence to the same temperature? Use @src/tests/agent-writer.md as the diagnostic. Be brutal.

The three worst stretches. Identify the three longest spans (10+ lines) that most urgently need rewriting, not because of colons or semicolons, but because the thinking is unclear, the motivation is missing, or the reader experience is bad. Explain what's wrong with each in prose, not bullet points.

What's actually good. Name specific passages that work well — where the voice is present, the argument lands, the reader is carried forward. We need to know what to protect.

Do NOT make any edits yet. Do not touch any .tex file. Only produce the reading report. We edit after we agree on the diagnosis.

Use @WRITING.md and @src/tests/agent-writer.md as your quality references. Use Aaronson and Harrow from @taste/ as your bar for what good sounds like, not zeeshan_ms_thesis.
