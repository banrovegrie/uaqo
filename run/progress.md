# Progress: Chapter 10 Voice Revision

## Session 1 — 2026-02-14

### Completed
- Rewrote opening paragraphs (lines 3-7): personal motivation (programming > math because rigor-as-tool), relay structure, Lean as laboratory, rigor/intuition/certainty line, infrastructure point, stats
- Removed AI paragraph (line 230)
- Changed "same learning process" to "same process" (line 21)
- Created planning files (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md)
- Researched taste/README.md for Aaronson voice markers
- Read full chapter and identified redundancies, signal sentences, and revision targets

### Phase 1 complete — all edits applied

Section 1 "What Formalization Taught Me":
- Replaced relay re-explanation opening with discovery-first paragraph ("The first thing Lean showed me was where I had been bundling independent claims.")
- Cut "A concrete example illustrates this separation." (signal)
- Cut "This is the kind of structural insight that I could not have found by reading alone." (tells reader what to think)
- Cut Hilbert/HoTT history paragraph entirely (throat-clearing, citations for Gonthier/Hales already in Section 5)
- Replaced relay-restating closing with short, specific version about spectral-complexity interface

Section 2 "Lean in Brief":
- Sharpened "A reader who wants to check..." to "Every claim in this chapter can be checked independently."

Section 4 "Two Proof Paths":
- Replaced structure-signaling opening with direct "Two proofs show what the formal system looks like in practice"

Section 5 "Assumptions and Boundaries":
- Rewrote formal-methods comparison: "None handle eigenvalues, spectral gaps, or complexity reductions. This development does."
- Rewrote closing to be forward-looking: specific extension targets (Garey-Johnson encoding, resolvent calculus), infrastructure framing

### Decisions
- Cut `hilbert1902problems` and `hottbook2013` citations (generic, not doing work)
- Kept all code listings and tables unchanged
- Left section titles unchanged (functional, not worth the risk of breaking cross-refs)
- Voevodsky influence is in the voice (honesty, infrastructure, rigor-as-tool), not in name-dropping

### Status: DONE
