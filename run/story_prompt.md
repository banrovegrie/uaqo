Hi Claude, consider the current @src/chapters/chapter3-struct.tex and @src/chapters/chapter4-struct.tex. They are essentially our chapter skeletons which we can use to actually write the chapters.

Why do they don't make the cut for being the chapters themselves? They read extremely dry as if they are disconnected pieces of bullet points which are forced together.

That is not the kind of essays or chapters that we want to be a part of a pristine thesis.

Thus, we shall be writing these chapters from scratch, in the manner that say Roger Penrose would have written.

Good writing respects the reader's time and rewards their attention. It leaves them interested, curious, amused, and pulls them forwards rather than dragging them through.

The whole thing must hold together and flow so that reading it leaves one changed rather than tired. It should have enough accessibility, depth, and good presentation that the reader actually enjoys reading and learns new things. Such writing should have its own pace. Not always breathtaking. Sometimes slow. Sometimes fast. Allowing for time to reflect and understand, allowing for suspense and surprise. The prose should be full and read well, avoiding unnecessary delimiters (like colons, semicolons, and em dashes unless absolutely necessary) or bloated language. And through all of this, mathematical and theoretical rigor should never be sacrificed. No narrowing claims, no replacing precise terms with vague ones, no cutting sentences that explain why a result matters.


- We want the chapters to flow like a story. Something that from first principles introduces the reader to QC and eventually AQC building on top of chapter 2 and then holding the batton down to Chapter 5.
- Make sure that we are not overcorrecting and make sure present everything in the best and natural way possible. Such that an experienced reader too might find it enjoyable to read and gain new perspective.
- We probably would have to do multiple multiple passes until we reach the way we want to write the chapters. Maybe we can use an intermediate md file(s) that we can delete later?
- We need story. We need rigor. We need depth.

STRUCTURE:
- Identify the chapter's spine. Write them out before touching any prose.
- Be willing to restructure entirely. Don't be afraid.
- Definition sequences are death.

WRITING:
- Every section opens with a tension or idk something interesting or beautiful.
- Definitions should be motivated.
- Every formal block has some interpretation (what changed? what can the reader now do?), if applicable. However, don't force it or overcorrect.
- Transitions carry argument, not navigation.
- Show authorial judgment. Have voice. But don't sound arrogant or like anything but curious. Like Roger Penrose.
- Warm prose is good. Filler is not.
- Make sure that the writing actually feels like written by someone with great care and love. Someone who have had themselves immersed into the subject.

WHAT NOT TO DO:
- Do not hedge where you should commit.
- Do not announce technique or do signaling. Execute. Signaling is when the writing talks about itself, its process, its sources, or its techniques instead of just executing.
- Do not write textbook-appendix prose. This is a thesis, not a manual.
- Do not sacrifice depth for brevity. A ten-line motivated derivation rather than 2 (for example) can still be good as long as that is really really meaningful to do so.
- Do not add filler to hit a length target. Short and vivid beats long and hollow.

DEPTH:
- The thesis must exceed the paper in exposition depth, motivation, and accessibility on every point it covers.
- Floor test: if the paper gives more detail on a point, the thesis must match or exceed it, or explicitly defer.
- Teaching test: could a graduate student new to AQO reconstruct the argument from this section?
