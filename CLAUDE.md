## Guidelines

All important content lives in `src/`. Two main file types exist:

### Writing

- Make sure that we have consistent formatting and notation.
- Avoid bullet points.
- Not a lot of subsections. Chapters and sections best.
- Avoid small paragraphs.
- Good citations. Not too less, not too many.

### Style

- Avoid `---` separators.
- No non-ASCII characters in the codebase.
- Everything should be aligned well.
