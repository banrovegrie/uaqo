# Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization

My master's thesis on Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization, supervised by Shantanav Chakraborty. Built on the published paper [Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization: Optimality with Limitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05736) (Braida, Chakraborty, Chaudhuri, Cunningham, Menavlikar, Novo, Roland, 2025).

Make sure that the way this thesis would be written is satisfactory to Prof. Shantanav Chakraborty (check `taste/` for papers by him). We also aim to beat the baseline expectations of the theses we have with us in `taste/` (of Zeeshan Ahmed and Ronald de Wolf).

### Chapter 4: Spectral Analysis of Adiabatic Optimization

This chapter develops the technical machinery for bounding the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic evolution. We divide [0,1] into three regions and apply different techniques to each.

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| 4.1 Setup and Strategy | H(s) = -(1-s)\|psi_0><psi_0\| + sH_z. Overview: why three regions, why different tools. |
| 4.2 The Symmetric Subspace | H_S = span{\|k>}. The M-dimensional invariant subspace. Reduction from N to M dimensions. |
| 4.3 The Eigenvalue Equation | Implicit equation: 1/(1-s) = (1/N) sum_k d_k/(sE_k - lambda). Structure of solutions. |
| 4.4 The Spectral Parameters | A_p = (1/N) sum_{k>=1} d_k/(E_k - E_0)^p. Central role of A_1 in everything that follows. |
| 4.5 The Avoided Crossing | Position s* = A_1/(A_1+1). Window delta_s = (2/(A_1+1)^2) sqrt(d_0 A_2/N). Minimum gap g_min = (2A_1/(A_1+1)) sqrt(d_0/(A_2 N)). |
| 4.6 Gap Bounds: Left Region | Variational principle with ansatz \|phi>. Bound: g(s) >= (A_1(A_1+1)/A_2)(s*-s). |
| 4.7 Gap Bounds: Right Region | Resolvent method. Line gamma(s) between eigenvalues. Sherman-Morrison. Bound: g(s) >= (Delta/30)(s-s_0)/(1-s_0). |
| 4.8 Synthesis | Three-region picture unified. Figure: true gap vs bounds. |

### Chapter 5: The Optimal Adiabatic Algorithm

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|

| 5.2 A Simplified Adiabatic Theorem | Phase randomization extension to continuous time. |
| 5.3 Running Time: The Three Integrals | I_left + I_window + I_right. Dominant contribution analysis. |
| 5.4 The Main Result | **Theorem (Main Result 1)**: T = O((1/epsilon) (sqrt(A_2)/(A_1^2 Delta^2)) sqrt(2^n/d_0)). |
| 5.5 Optimality for Ising Hamiltonians | When Delta >= 1/poly(n): A_1, A_2 bounded. Runtime T = O~(sqrt(2^n/d_0)) matches lower bound. |
| 5.6 What the Algorithm Requires | Knowledge of s* to precision O(delta_s). This means knowing A_1 to precision ~2^{-n/2}. |

### Chapter 6: The Hardness of Optimality

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| 6.1 The Hidden Requirement | Schedule construction needs A_1 to precision delta_s. |
| 6.2 Disambiguation via A_1 | Given H with promise on E_0. Two A_1 queries distinguish cases. |
| 6.3 The Modified Hamiltonian | H' = H tensor (I + sigma_z)/2. Effect on spectrum and A_1. |
| 6.4 NP-Hardness | **Theorem (Main Result 2)**: Two calls to oracle for A_1 at precision epsilon < 1/(72(n-1)) solve 3-SAT. |
| 6.5 Polynomial Interpolation | Query A_1(H'(x)) for O(poly(n)) values. Reconstruct polynomial P(x). Extract degeneracies d_k. |
| 6.6 #P-Hardness | **Theorem (Main Result 3)**: O(poly(n)) calls to exact A_1 oracle extract all degeneracies. #P-hard. |
| 6.7 Robustness | Paturi's lemma, Berlekamp-Welch. Hardness at epsilon = O(2^{-poly(n)}). |
| 6.8 The Fundamental Asymmetry | Circuit model has no such barrier. The precision gap: required ~2^{-n/2}, NP-hard at 1/poly(n). |

### Chapter 7: Conclusion

This chapter synthesizes results, presents explorations beyond the paper, and identifies open problems.

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| 7.1 Summary of Results | The trilogy: optimal algorithm, NP-hard preprocessing, #P-hard exactly. |
| 7.2 What We Explored | Quantum calibration idea: can experiments estimate A_1? Loschmidt echo approach attempted. |
| 7.3 What We Found | **Validated**: gap formula g_min = 2A_1 sqrt(d_0/(A_2 N)) for time-independent H(r). Resonance at r = A_1. **Failed**: Loschmidt echo calibration does not work; multi-level interference destroys signature. |
| 7.4 The Precision Gap | What is complexity at intermediate precisions 2^{-n^alpha}? Open problem. |
| 7.5 The Standard AQO Setting | H_0 = -sum sigma_x^j. Multiple crossings. Different spectral structure. |
| 7.6 Open Problems | Tractable classes. Catalyst qubits. QAOA connections. Noise effects. |
| 7.7 Closing Remarks | The deeper question: what do these barriers tell us about quantum speedups? |
