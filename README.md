# Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization

My master's thesis on Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization, supervised by Shantanav Chakraborty. Built on the published paper [Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization: Optimality with Limitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05736) (Braida, Chakraborty, Chaudhuri, Cunningham, Menavlikar, Novo, Roland, 2025).

Make sure that the way this thesis would be written is satisfactory to Prof. Shantanav Chakraborty (check `taste/` for papers by him). We also aim to beat the baseline expectations of the theses we have with us in `taste/` (of Zeeshan Ahmed and Ronald de Wolf).

## Table of Contents

This thesis aims to be a single coherent path from first principles to the main results of `paper/` (arXiv:2411.05736) and `rough/`, and to the extensions in `src/experiments/`.

- Chapter 1: Introduction
- Chapter 2: Physics and Computation
- Chapter 3: Quantum Computation
- Chapter 4: Adiabatic Quantum Computation
- Chapter 5: Adiabatic Quantum Optimization
- Chapter 6: Spectral Analysis
- Chapter 7: Optimal Schedule
- Chapter 8: Hardness of Optimality
- Chapter 9: Information Gap
- Chapter 10: Formalization
- Chapter 11: Conclusion

The chapters should be written in this order:

```
5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 1 -> 11
```

**Why this order:**

1. **Core chapters first (5-8):** These are the heart of the thesis, directly exposing the published paper's main results. Chapter 5 sets up AQO, Chapter 6 does spectral analysis, Chapter 7 derives the optimal runtime, Chapter 8 proves hardness. Writing these first ensures the technical spine is solid before anything else.

2. **Extensions next (9):** Chapter 9 contains original contributions (separation theorem, partial information, robust/adaptive schedules). It builds directly on Chapters 5-8 and should be written while that content is fresh.

3. **Background backward (4-3-2):** Background chapters are written after the core to ensure they define exactly what is needed and nothing more. Writing them backward (from AQC to QC to Physics) ensures each chapter prepares precisely for what follows. Avoids over-explaining or under-explaining.

4. **Formalization (10):** Documents the Lean proofs. Best written after all mathematical content is stable, so the formalization section accurately reflects what was proven.

5. **Framing last (1, 11):** Introduction and Conclusion are written last because they must reflect actual content. The Introduction previews results that exist; the Conclusion summarizes what was achieved. Writing them early leads to promises the thesis doesn't keep.


### Chapter 1: Introduction

**Overview:** Sets up the thesis problem, states main results upfront, and provides roadmap. Written last to reflect actual content.

**Depends on:** Knowing content of all other chapters.

- **Section: The Puzzle**
  - Ground states as computational answers: physical systems seek low-energy configurations
  - Encode computational problem in Hamiltonian $H$; ground state encodes solution
  - "Let nature compute" - attractive idea
  - The question: Can physical systems solve hard problems efficiently? Can quantum beat classical for optimization?
  - TODO: Build tension before resolution; don't answer too quickly
  - REVIEWER: presentation_quality - Hook the reader

- **Section: Unstructured Search as Canonical Target**
  - The search problem: find marked item among $N$ items, no structure (oracle model)
  - Classical: $O(N)$ queries required (must check every item)
  - Quantum: $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries via Grover, provably optimal (BBBV)
  - Why this is the right benchmark: clean problem, clear lower bound, quadratic speedup achieved by circuits
  - Question: can AQO match this?
  - FORWARD: Chapters 3 (Grover), 7 (AQO matches it)

- **Section: Adiabatic Quantum Optimization**
  - AQC idea: encode problem in $H_z$, start with easy $H_0$, interpolate $H(s) = (1-s)H_0 + sH_z$, evolve slowly
  - AQO = AQC with restrictions: $H_z$ diagonal, $H_0$ is projector, only schedule $s(t)$ adjustable
  - The appeal: "Nature computes for you", no explicit gates, potentially robust
  - The catch (preview): schedule requires gap knowledge, gap info is expensive
  - TODO: Make AQO appealing before showing limitations
  - FORWARD: Chapter 4 (AQC), Chapter 5 (AQO setup)

- **Section: The Trilogy - Main Results Frontloaded**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex Theorems 1-3
  - (i) Optimality exists: $T = \tilde{O}(\sqrt{N/d_0})$, matches Grover (Chapter 7)
  - (ii) Computing schedule parameters is NP-hard: $A_1$ to $1/\text{poly}(n)$ reduces 3-SAT (Chapter 8)
  - (iii) Exact parameter values are $\#P$-hard: polynomial interpolation attack (Chapter 8)
  - The tension: optimal speedup exists but requires solving NP-hard problem first
  - "Optimality with limitations"
  - TODO: State results crisply, create tension
  - REVIEWER: significance - This is the paper's contribution

- **Section: The Central Question**
  - When does "nature computes for you" actually work?
  - Naive view: set up Hamiltonian, wait, measure
  - Reality: must choose schedule $s(t)$, optimal requires gap info, gap info is NP-hard
  - Reframing: not "can AQO achieve speedup?" but "when is gap information tractable?"
  - This thesis: proves optimality/hardness (5-8), characterizes tradeoff (9), machine-checks (10)
  - FORWARD: Chapter 9 (information gap)

- **Section: Thesis Contributions**
  - Exposition of published work: deep explanation (Chapters 5-8), pedagogical, broader context
  - Original extensions (Chapter 9): separation theorem, partial information, robust/adaptive schedules
  - Chapter 9 context: extends Guo-An 2025's gap-informed baseline to uninformed/partial/adaptive regimes
  - Formalization (Chapter 10): Lean 4, machine-checked, errors caught
  - Goal: best single source, clear enough to teach, rigorous enough to build on
  - REVIEWER: originality - Clear about contributions

- **Section: Chapter Overview and Reading Paths**
  - Background (can skim): Chapters 2-4
  - Core paper results (essential): Chapters 5-8
  - Extensions (original): Chapter 9
  - Verification: Chapter 10
  - Conclusion: Chapter 11

- **Section: Hamiltonians as Energy**
  - SOURCE: Standard QM, Nielsen-Chuang
  - Hermitian operator: $H = H^\dagger$, real eigenvalues $E_k$, eigenvectors $|k\rangle$
  - Spectral decomposition: $H = \sum_k E_k |k\rangle\langle k|$ (non-degenerate), $H = \sum_k E_k P_k$ (degenerate)
  - Ground state: lowest eigenvalue $E_0$, encodes solution for optimization
  - Spectral gap: $g = E_1 - E_0$, central to adiabatic computation
  - TODO: Handle degeneracy ($d_k$-fold); emphasize spectral gap
  - NOTE: "Spectral gap" defined here; Chapter 4 discusses computational role
  - FORWARD: Chapters 5-6 analyze spectral gap of $H(s)$
  - REVIEWER: technical_soundness - Definitions must be precise

- **Section: Time Evolution**
  - SOURCE: Nielsen-Chuang Chapter 2
  - Schrodinger equation (time-independent): $i \, d|\psi\rangle/dt = H|\psi\rangle$
  - Solution: $|\psi(t)\rangle = e^{-iHt}|\psi(0)\rangle = U(t)|\psi(0)\rangle$, unitary
  - Time-dependent $H(t)$: more complex, time-ordered exponential, relevant for AQC

  - FORWARD: Chapter 4 uses time-dependent $H(s)$
  - REVIEWER: technical_soundness - Units and conventions

- **Section: Why Quantum Helps**
  - Superposition: $N = 2^n$ amplitudes in $n$ qubits (NOT parallel computation)
  - Interference: amplitudes add, cancel wrong, amplify correct - key to speedups
  - Tunneling: traverse classically forbidden regions (debated for optimization)
  - Entanglement: non-classical correlations (less central to AQO)
  - TODO: Be honest about proven vs hoped; tunneling claims controversial

  - SOURCE: Nielsen-Chuang, Arora-Barak
  - Gate model: universal gates, circuit depth/width, polynomial = BQP
  - BQP: polynomial-time quantum, probability $\geq 2/3$, $P \subseteq BQP \subseteq PSPACE$
  - Oracle model: black-box $f$, quantum oracle $|x,y\rangle \to |x, y \oplus f(x)\rangle$, query count
  - For thesis: Grover $O(\sqrt{N})$ optimal, AQO doesn't use oracles but $H_z$ encodes $f$

  - Runtime: $\pi/(4\theta) \sim \sqrt{N}$ iterations
  - Why geometric view matters: optimality transparent, connects to AQO two-level structure

  - FORWARD: Chapter 5 has similar two-level structure near $s^*$
  - REVIEWER: presentation_quality - Geometry before algebra

- **Section: Why Grover is Optimal**
  - SOURCE: Bennett-Bernstein-Brassard-Vazirani (1997)

  - REVIEWER: presentation_quality - Set expectations clearly

### Chapter 4: Adiabatic Quantum Computation

**Overview:** Introduces AQC and sets up framework for AQO. Bridges general quantum computation to specific AQO setting.

**Needs:** Chapter 3 (Hamiltonians, eigenvalues, time evolution, Grover), Chapter 2 (complexity, optimization)

**Forward:** Chapter 5 (AQO with diagonal $H_z$), Chapter 7 (Roland-Cerf schedule)

**Definitions introduced:** adiabatic theorem, spectral gap as computational resource, avoided crossing, local schedule

- **Section: Physical Motivation**
  - SOURCE: Sakurai, Griffiths
  - Adiabatic theorem: slow evolution stays in ground state
  - Gap determines how slow is slow enough
  - Physical intuition: system tracks changing potential
  - TODO: Concrete physical example; distinguish quantum vs thermodynamic "adiabatic"
  - REVIEWER: presentation_quality - Physical intuition before formalism

- **Section: The Computational Idea**
  - SOURCE: Farhi et al. (2001)
  - Encode problem in $H_z$ (ground state = solution), start with easy $H_0$
  - Interpolate: $H(s) = (1-s)H_0 + sH_z$ for $s \in [0,1]$
  - Read answer: measure at $s=1$
  - Chapter 5 specializes: $H_0 = -|\psi_0\rangle\langle\psi_0|$, $H_z$ diagonal
  - TODO: Explain encoding of optimization problems
  - FORWARD: Chapter 5 uses $H(s) = -(1-s)|\psi_0\rangle\langle\psi_0| + sH_z$

- **Section: The Adiabatic Theorem**
  - SOURCE: Born-Fock (1928), Kato (1950), Jansen-Ruskai-Seiler (2007)
  - Statement: if slow enough, stay in instantaneous ground state
  - Quantitative: Error $\leq C \cdot \max|dH/ds| / \min g(s)^2$
  - Implications: runtime $\sim 1/g_{\min}^2$ worst case
  - Note: Chapter 7 uses a NEW simplified version with local gap bounds (not just Jansen-Ruskai-Seiler)
  - TODO: State precisely with conditions; distinguish from original qualitative theorem
  - FORWARD: Chapter 7 uses this for runtime
  - REVIEWER: technical_soundness - State conditions carefully

- **Section: The Spectral Gap as Central Bridge**
  - Gap connects physics to complexity
  - Physics: large gap = robust, fast; small gap = fragile, slow
  - Computational: large = easy, small = hard/slow
  - Gap as bottleneck: $T \sim 1/g_{\min}^2$, QMA-hardness from gap estimation
  - TODO: Connect to QMA and local Hamiltonian problem
  - FORWARD: Chapters 5-6 analyze gap structure
  - REVIEWER: significance - Gap is central object of thesis

- **Section: Avoided Crossings**
  - SOURCE: Landau (1932), Zener (1932)
  - Definition: energy levels approach but don't cross (repel due to coupling)
  - Landau-Zener: $P \sim \exp(-\pi g_{\min}^2 / (2v))$, must slow near crossings
  - Gap minimum typically at avoided crossing; single crossing simplifies (AQO case)
  - TODO: Derive Landau-Zener or give intuition; non-crossing theorem
  - FORWARD: Chapter 5 has single crossing at $s^*$, Chapter 6 bounds three regions
  - REVIEWER: presentation_quality - Intuition before formula

- **Section: Schedules**
  - Linear: $s(t) = t/T$, simple but not optimal, wastes time where gap large
  - Adaptive: $ds/dt \sim g(s)^2$, slow where small, fast where large
  - Gap-aware vs gap-unaware: knows $g(s)$ or must work for all instances
  - TODO: Compare runtimes; set up gap-uninformed problem (Chapter 9)
  - FORWARD: Chapter 7 constructs optimal, Chapter 9 analyzes uninformed

- **Section: Roland-Cerf Construction**
  - SOURCE: Roland-Cerf (2002)
  - First AQC achieving Grover speedup
  - Setup: $H_0 = -|s\rangle\langle s|$, $H_z = I - |w\rangle\langle w|$, single marked item
  - Key insight: slow only where gap small, adapt $ds/dt \sim g(s)^2$
  - Result: $T = O(\sqrt{N})$, matches circuit Grover
  - Why matters: shows AQO can match Grover, Chapter 5 generalizes
  - TODO: Present as special case of AQO; emphasize single crossing
  - FORWARD: Chapter 5 generalizes
  - REVIEWER: significance - Foundation for Chapter 5

- **Section: Universality**
  - SOURCE: Aharonov et al. (2007)
  - AQC computationally equivalent to circuit model (polynomial overhead both ways)
  - Implications: universal, no fundamental power difference, but different resources
  - TODO: Cite properly; explain equivalence briefly
  - OPTION: Could be brief or detailed
  - REVIEWER: literature - Must cite universality

- **Section: Why AQO is More Restricted**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex
  - AQO restrictions: $H_z$ diagonal, no entanglement in $H_z$, $H_0$ projector, only schedule adjustable
  - General AQC: any Hamiltonians
  - Why study AQO? Natural for combinatorics, simpler spectral structure, clean analysis
  - TODO: Explain diagonal constraint; list encodable problems
  - FORWARD: Chapter 5 formalizes

- **Section: The No-Free-Lunch Reality**
  - Misconception: "Just let nature compute"
  - Reality: gap determines runtime, can't run uniformly slow, optimal schedule needs gap info, gap info is NP-hard
  - Tension: AQO achieves Grover (Ch 7) but requires solving hard problem (Ch 8)
  - Preview: $T = \tilde{O}(\sqrt{N/d_0})$, needs $s^*$ to exponential precision, $A_1$ is NP-hard
  - TODO: Frame central tension; set up Chapters 5-9
  - FORWARD: Chapters 5-9 resolve this
  - REVIEWER: significance - Sets up thesis problem

### Chapter 5: Adiabatic Quantum Optimization

**Overview:** Sets up the AQO framework that subsequent chapters analyze. Establishes $H(s)$, spectral parameters $A_p$, avoided crossing structure.

**Needs:** Chapter 3 (Hilbert spaces, eigenstates, spectral decomposition), Chapter 4 (adiabatic theorem concept)

**Forward:** Chapter 6 (gap analysis), Chapter 7 (runtime integral), Chapter 8 (hardness reduction)

- **Section: The Setup**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 250-251, 277-281
  - Diagonal $H_z$: classical energies on computational basis
  - Problem Hamiltonian: $H_z = \sum_z E_z|z\rangle\langle z|$
  - Initial Hamiltonian: projector $H_0 = -|\psi_0\rangle\langle\psi_0|$
  - Equal superposition: $|\psi_0\rangle = (1/\sqrt{N}) \sum_z |z\rangle$
  - Adiabatic Hamiltonian: $H(s) = -(1-s)|\psi_0\rangle\langle\psi_0| + sH_z$
  - TODO: Motivate why this form before stating; connect to Grover as special case
  - REVIEWER: presentation_quality - WHY before HOW

- **Section: Problem Hamiltonian Structure**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 252-260, Definition 1 lines 268-275
  - Spectrum: $E_0 < E_1 < \ldots < E_{M-1}$ ($M$ distinct levels)
  - Degeneracies: $d_k$ = number of states at energy $E_k$
  - Ground states: $d_0$ states with energy $E_0$ (solutions)
  - Total: $\sum_k d_k = N = 2^n$
  - Eigenvalue sets: $\Omega_k = \{z : H_z|z\rangle = E_k|z\rangle\}$, $|\Omega_k| = d_k$
  - TODO: Concrete example early; explain $M \ll N$ typically
  - REVIEWER: technical_soundness - Match notation exactly

- **Section: The Spectral Condition**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 270-275, 282
  - Condition: $(1/\Delta) \cdot \sqrt{d_0/(A_2 N)} < c$, where $c \approx 0.02$
  - Ensures avoided crossing is "clean" (not overlapping)
  - Satisfied by any $H_z$ with $\Delta > (1/c) \cdot \sqrt{d_0/N}$
  - Ising Hamiltonians with $\Delta \geq 1/\text{poly}(n)$ satisfy this
  - TODO: Intuition - what goes wrong without? $c=0.02$ from Appendix A.3
  - OPTION: Defer to after $A_2$ defined, or state informally first
  - REVIEWER: technical_soundness - State explicitly with all terms

- **Section: The Interpolation**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 277-281, 297
  - $H(s) = -(1-s)|\psi_0\rangle\langle\psi_0| + sH_z$
  - At $s=0$: ground state is $|\psi_0\rangle$
  - At $s=1$: ground state encodes solutions
  - Single avoided crossing (projector form ensures this)
  - TODO: Contrast with standard AQC; why projector gives single crossing
  - REVIEWER: significance - Key simplification enabling analysis

- **Section: Why This Form**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 290, 297
  - Equal superposition: no bias toward any solution
  - Projector form: single non-trivial eigenvalue at $s=0$
  - CRITICAL: Projector form ensures single avoided crossing (vs general AQC with multiple)
  - Why single crossing matters: enables three-region analysis (Ch 6), tight gap bounds, optimal schedule
  - General AQC may have multiple crossings, complicating analysis and potentially requiring different techniques
  - Symmetry under permutations of equal-energy states
  - TODO: "Clean" is vague - make precise; permutation symmetry -> dimension reduction
  - OPTION: Merge with "The Interpolation"
  - REVIEWER: presentation_quality - Avoid vague claims

- **Section: Spectral Parameters**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 257-260 (Eq. 8)
  - $A_p = (1/N) \sum_{k=1}^{M-1} d_k/(E_k - E_0)^p$, sum starts at $k=1$
  - $A_1$: determines crossing position $s^* = A_1/(A_1+1)$
  - $A_2$: determines minimum gap $g_{\min} \sim \sqrt{d_0/(N \cdot A_2)}$
  - Both are functions of spectrum $\{(E_k, d_k)\}$
  - Roles: (i) crossing position, (ii) runtime, (iii) hardness
  - TODO: Numerical example; bounds $A_2 \geq 1 - 1/N$
  - REVIEWER: spectral_parameters - CRITICAL: match paper exactly

- **Section: $A_1$ as the Key Parameter**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 300-303, 261
  - Crossing position: $s^* = A_1/(A_1 + 1)$ (Eq. 10)
  - For Ising with $\Delta > 1/\text{poly}(n)$: $s^* = 1/2 + O(2^{-n})$
  - $A_1$ encodes energy level distribution
  - Sensitivity to degeneracy structure (changes $d_k$ -> changes $A_1$)
  - TODO: $A_1 \to \infty$ implies $s^* \to 1$; sensitivity leads to hardness
  - REVIEWER: significance - $A_1$ central to main results

- **Section: Symmetry Reduction**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 422-447, 494-498
  - Permutation symmetry: states at same energy equivalent
  - Symmetric subspace $\mathcal{H}_S = \text{span}\{|k\rangle\}$, $|k\rangle = (1/\sqrt{d_k}) \sum_{z \in \Omega_k} |z\rangle$
  - Effective dimension: $M$ (not $N$)
  - Complement $\mathcal{H}_S^\perp$ has dimension $N-M$
  - Key: $|\psi_0\rangle \in \mathcal{H}_S$, so evolution stays in $\mathcal{H}_S$
  - Reduces $N \times N$ to $M \times M$ analysis
  - TODO: Why powerful ($M = \text{poly}(n)$, $N = 2^n$); explicit basis construction
  - REVIEWER: technical_soundness - Reduction essential for tractability

- **Section: The Eigenvalue Equation**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 449-490 (Lemma 1)
  - Lemma 1: $\lambda(s)$ is eigenvalue of $H(s)$ iff:
    - (a) $\lambda(s) = sE_k$ for some $k$, or
    - (b) $1/(1-s) = (1/N) \sum_k d_k/(sE_k - \lambda(s))$
  - Implicit equation from rank-1 update (Golub 1973)
  - RHS monotonically decreasing in each interval, guarantees $M$ solutions in $\mathcal{H}_S$
  - TODO: Include proof or defer; discuss monotonicity and pole structure
  - OPTION: State lemma, intuition, defer proof
  - REVIEWER: technical_soundness - Foundational lemma

- **Section: The Avoided Crossing**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 300-313

  - Width: $\delta_s = 2/(A_1+1)^2 \cdot \sqrt{d_0 A_2/N}$ (Eq. 11)
  - Minimum gap: $g_{\min} = 2A_1/(A_1+1) \cdot \sqrt{d_0/(N \cdot A_2)}$ (Eq. 12)
  - Window: $I_{s^*} = [s^* - \delta_s, s^* + \delta_s]$
  - Derivation uses two-level approximation near $s^*$
  - TODO: Show where formulas come from (Chapter 6); compare to Grover $g_{\min} \sim 1/\sqrt{N}$
  - REVIEWER: gap_bounds - CRITICAL: formulas must match paper

  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 314-328
  - Three regions (detailed in Chapter 6):
    1. Left $I_{s<-} = [0, s^* - \delta_s)$: gap grows linearly
    2. Window $I_{s^*} = [s^* - \delta_s, s^* + \delta_s]$: gap $\sim g_{\min}$
    3. Right $I_{s->} = (s^* + \delta_s, 1]$: gap grows toward $\Delta$

### Chapter 6: Spectral Analysis

**Overview:** Bounds $g(s)$ across $[0,1]$ using three-region analysis. Central technical contribution: tight gap bounds enable runtime calculation.

**Needs:** Chapter 5 ($H(s)$, $A_1$, $A_2$, $s^*$, $\delta_s$, $g_{\min}$), Chapter 3 (variational principle, spectral decomposition)

**Forward:** Chapter 7 (runtime integral), Chapter 9 (gap profile for information analysis)

- **Section: The Challenge**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 297, 488-492
  - Bound gap $g(s) = \lambda_1(s) - \lambda_0(s)$ for all $s \in [0,1]$
  - Gap determines adiabatic runtime ($T \sim \int 1/g(s)^2 \, ds$)
  - Non-uniform: gap varies significantly across $s$
  - Eigenvalue equation gives intervals but not tight bounds
  - Need lower bounds for runtime upper bound
  - TODO: Motivate why hard (multiple upper crossings); reference Figure 1
  - REVIEWER: presentation_quality - Challenge before solutions

    1. Left $I_{s<-}$: variational principle
    2. Window $I_{s^*}$: two-level approximation
    3. Right $I_{s->}$: resolvent method
  - Key insight: left/right gaps EXCEED window gap - crossing is localized, three-region works
  - Why this works: outside window, gap is $O(s^* - s)$ or $O(s - s^*)$, both exceed $O(\delta_s) = O(g_{\min})$

  - Upper bound: $g(s) \leq \kappa' \cdot g_{\min}$

  - Variational ansatz: $|\phi\rangle = 1/\sqrt{A_2 N} \cdot \sum_{k \geq 1} \sqrt{d_k}/(E_k-E_0) |k\rangle$
  - Calculation: $\lambda_0(s) \leq sE_0 + A_1/A_2 \cdot (s-s^*)/(1-s^*)$
  - Lower bound: $\lambda_1(s) \geq sE_0$
  - Combining: $g(s) \geq A_1/A_2 \cdot (s^*-s)/(1-s^*)$

### Chapter 7: Optimal Schedule

**Overview:** Constructs optimal schedule and derives runtime. Central result: $T = \tilde{O}(\sqrt{N/d_0})$ matches Grover. Critical caveat: requires $s^*$ to exponential precision.

**Needs:** Chapter 5 ($H(s)$, $A_1$, $A_2$, $s^*$, $\delta_s$, $g_{\min}$), Chapter 6 (gap bounds), Chapter 4 (adiabatic theorem)

**Forward:** Chapter 8 (computing $s^*$ is hard), Chapter 9 (what without precise $s^*$)

- **Section: The Adiabatic Theorem**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 356, 405, 710-712, Appendix A.4
  - SOURCE: rough/AQCbound.tex for rigorous derivation
  - NOTE: This is a NEW simplified adiabatic theorem (line 405), not just Jansen-Ruskai-Seiler refinement
  - Statement: slow evolution stays near ground state, "slow" = $|dH/ds \cdot ds/dt| \ll g(s)^2$
  - Final fidelity $\geq 1-\epsilon$ with ground state
  - Key simplification: works directly with local gap lower bound $g(s)$, not global $g_{\min}$
  - Refs: Roland-Cerf (local adaptive), van Dam (necessity), Cunningham et al. (phase randomization)
  - Generic result: works for any twice-differentiable $H(s)$ with known gap lower bound
  - TODO: State precise theorem; emphasize novelty over Jansen-Ruskai-Seiler (local vs global)
  - REVIEWER: technical_soundness - Statement must be precise

- **Section: Local Adaptive Schedule**
  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 356, 712, 722
  - Key insight: slow down where gap small, $ds/dt \sim g(s)$
  - Uniform gives $T \sim 1/g_{\min}^2 \cdot L$; local integrates $1/g(s)^2 \, ds$

  - Gap bounds restated from Chapter 6
  - TODO: Show how bounds simplify calculation
  - REVIEWER: technical_soundness - Use exact bounds from paper

- **Section: Left Region Contribution**
  - Gap $g(s) \geq c_L \cdot (s^* - s)$, $c_L = A_1(A_1+1)/A_2$
  - Integral $\leq 1/c_L^2 \cdot (1/\delta_s - 1/s^*) \sim 1/c_L^2 \cdot 1/\delta_s$

  - SOURCE: paper/v3-quantum.tex lines 731
  - Gap $\geq g_{\min}$, integral $\leq 2\delta_s / g_{\min}^2$
  - This is DOMINANT contribution
  - Substituting: $\delta_s / g_{\min}^2 \sim \sqrt{N/d_0}$ times spectral factors
  - Key: $\sqrt{N/d_0}$ Grover-like, $\sqrt{A_2}/A_1^2$ correction, $1/\Delta^2$ from $g_{\min}$
  - TODO: Step-by-step; verify matches Theorem 1
  - REVIEWER: gap_bounds - CRITICAL: window dominates

- **Section: Right Region Contribution**
  - Gap $\geq c_R \cdot (s - s^*)$, integral $\sim 1/c_R^2 \cdot 1/\delta_s$

  - Precision needed: $s^*$ to $O(\delta_s) = O(2^{-n/2})$
  - $A_1$ precision determines $s^*$ precision: need $A_1$ such that $|s^* - s^*_{\text{true}}| < O(\delta_s)$
  - Since $s^* = A_1/(A_1+1)$, error propagates as: $\delta_{s^*} \sim \delta_{A_1}/(A_1+1)^2$
  - Why: gap bounds depend on $(s - s^*)$, wrong $s^*$ misses crossing window
  - What can approximate: $A_2$ (constant for Ising), $d_0 = 1$ (lower bound)

  - Catch: needs $s^*$ to exponential precision, $s^* = A_1/(A_1+1)$, $A_1$ is bottleneck
  - Tension: theoretically achievable but requires hard problem
  - REVIEWER: significance - Convey both achievement and limitation

### Chapter 8: Hardness of Optimality

**Overview:** Proves computing $A_1$ is NP-hard at polynomial precision, $\#P$-hard at exponential. Central result: "Optimality with limitations."

### Chapter 9: Information Gap

**Overview:** Original contributions characterizing information-optimality tradeoff. Extensions beyond published paper. Central thesis: AQO optimality is fundamentally an information question.

**Context:** Extends Guo-An 2025's gap-informed baseline to uninformed/partial/adaptive regimes. Recent work (Guo-An 2025) shows gap-informed scheduling achieves optimal $O(1/\Delta_*)$. This chapter asks: what if gap information is unavailable, uncertain, or costly?

**Needs:** Chapter 5 ($H(s)$, $A_1$, $s^*$, $\delta_s$, $g_{\min}$), Chapter 7 (runtime, schedule), Chapter 8 (hardness)

**Status:** Most results have Lean formalization (noted per section)

**RELATED WORK:** Guo-An 2025 (gap-informed baseline, measure condition), Han-Park-Choi 2025 (adaptive measurement), Roland-Cerf 2002 (original adaptive schedule)

  - Problem: How much slower is gap-uninformed vs gap-informed?
  - Main Result: $T_{\text{uninformed}} / T_{\text{informed}} \geq (s_R - s_L) / \Delta_*$
  - Corollary: $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ separation for $n$-qubit search
  - Proof: adversarial construction, velocity bound, time lower bound
  - Why novel: no prior minimax lower bound for FIXED uninformed schedules
  - Assumptions from literature: error model, informed achievability
  - Caveats: minimax not single-instance, fixed schedules only

  - Main Result: $T(\epsilon) = T_{\inf} \cdot \Theta(\max(1, \epsilon/\delta_{A_1}))$
  - For unstructured: $T(\epsilon) = T_{\inf} \cdot \Theta(\max(1, \epsilon \cdot 2^{n/2}))$
  - Key Finding: Interpolation is LINEAR in $\epsilon$
  - Implications: no threshold, smooth degradation, NP-hard precision still exponential overhead

  - Main Result: Hedging achieves constant-factor approximation
  - Error formula: $\text{Error}_{\text{hedge}} / \text{Error}_{\text{unif}} \to (u_R - u_L)$ as interval narrows
  - Example: $[0.4, 0.8]$ achieves ~60% reduction vs uniform
  - Key insight: NP-hardness is "soft" - bounded uncertainty = constant factor

  - Theorem 2: $\Omega(n)$ measurements required (binary search optimal)
  - Complete characterization: $T_{\text{uninformed}} = \Omega(2^{n/2} \cdot T_{\inf})$, $T_{\text{adaptive}} = O(T_{\inf})$

  - SOURCE: src/experiments/06_measure_condition/main.md
  - LEAN: Complete, no sorry

  - Measure condition: $\mu(\{s : \Delta(s) \leq x\}) \leq C \cdot x$
  - Theorem 1 (Geometric): For $\Delta(s) = \Delta_* + \Theta(|s - s^*|^\alpha)$, $\alpha \leq 1$ holds, $\alpha > 1$ fails

### Chapter 11: Conclusion

**Overview:** Synthesizes thesis results, discusses implications, lists open problems. Written last to reflect actual content.

**Depends on:** Knowing content of all other chapters

- **Section: The Trilogy Revisited**
  - SOURCE: Chapters 5-8
  - One-page summary of main results:
    - Main Result 1 (Chapter 7): $T = \tilde{O}(\sqrt{N/d_0})$, matches Grover, requires local adaptive schedule
    - Main Result 2 (Chapter 8): $A_1$ to $1/\text{poly}(n)$ is NP-hard (two oracle calls, 3-SAT)
    - Main Result 3 (Chapter 8): $A_1$ exactly is $\#P$-hard (polynomial interpolation, $d_0$ extraction)
  - The synthesis: optimality exists but requires NP-hard problem
  - "Optimality with limitations" captures this tension
  - TODO: Crisp one-paragraph per result
  - REVIEWER: presentation_quality - Clear summary

- **Section: The Conceptual Takeaway**
  - "Optimality with limitations" as paradigm
  - What we learned: information determines speedup, gap is both bottleneck and barrier, same Grover speedup has different costs in different models
  - Gap as bridge: physics (energy), computation (runtime/hardness), information (NP-hard to compute)
  - New perspective: not "does AQO work?" but "when is gap information tractable?"
  - TODO: Frame as paradigm shift
  - REVIEWER: significance - Conceptual contribution matters

- **Section: Comparison with Circuit Model**
  - AQO vs Grover circuit: same $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{N/d_0})$ speedup
  - Different information requirements: Grover needs oracle access only, AQO needs $A_1$ to exponential precision
  - Asymmetry: Grover queries adaptively DURING execution; AQO needs schedule UPFRONT
  - Key insight: circuit gathers spectral info through queries as it runs; AQO must commit before evolution
  - This is a genuine model difference, not an artifact of analysis
  - TODO: Make asymmetry vivid
  - REVIEWER: significance - Important conceptual point

- **Section: What This Changes**
  - Implications for AQO research:
  - Evaluating proposals: not just "what is gap?" but "how hard to compute gap?"
  - New question: from "can AQO be fast?" to "when is $A_1$ tractable?"
  - Experimental: scheduling needs $A_1$ or adaptive measurement, deviations may be fundamental
  - TODO: Connect to practical AQO/annealing
  - REVIEWER: significance - Practical relevance

- **Section: Original Contributions (Chapter 9)**
  - Context: extends Guo-An 2025's gap-informed baseline to uninformed/partial/adaptive regimes
  - Summary of extensions:
    1. Separation Theorem: $T_{\text{uninformed}} / T_{\text{informed}} \geq (s_R - s_L) / \Delta_*$, $\Omega(2^{n/2})$, LEAN complete
    2. Partial Information: $T(\epsilon) = T_{\inf} \cdot \Theta(\max(1, \epsilon/\delta_{A_1}))$, linear, LEAN complete
    3. Measure Condition: $T = \Theta(1/\Delta_*^{3-2/\alpha})$, dichotomy FALSE, LEAN complete
    4. Robust Schedules: hedging constant-factor, LEAN partial
    5. Adaptive Schedules: $O(n)$ measurements suffice, LEAN partial
  - Ignorance taxonomy: no info (exponential), intermediate (linear in $\epsilon$), bounded (constant), quantum measurement (logarithmic)
  - TODO: Connect back to central thesis
  - REVIEWER: originality - These are novel contributions

- **Section: The Formalization Standard (Chapter 10)**

    2. Verification: 27 axioms, 76+ theorems, 0 sorries
    3. Reproducibility: Lean compiles = proofs valid
  - Axiom boundary: external foundations, gap bounds (parametric spectral), novel math fully proved
  - TODO: Advocate for formalization in QC
  - REVIEWER: significance - Formalization contribution

- **Section: Open Problems**
  - Research directions:
    1. Structured instances: when is $A_1$ efficiently computable? (planted SAT, specific graphs)
    2. Noise models: decoherence effects on tradeoffs, open-system adiabatic
    3. Intermediate precision: what can polynomial precision achieve? useful regimes?
    4. Alternative paths: non-linear interpolations, catalyst Hamiltonians, counterdiabatic
    5. Quantum annealing: real devices use thermal, what does analysis say?
    6. Ultimate question: is there a family where AQO beats circuits? (needs tractable $A_1$)
  - TODO: Be specific about what is open
  - REVIEWER: significance - Guide future work

- **Section: Final Remarks**
  - What we set out to do: explain UAQO deeply, broader context, extend, verify
  - What we achieved: complete exposition, information characterization, Lean with errors fixed, unified perspective
  - Central message: AQO matches Grover but optimality requires NP-hard info, "optimality with limitations", gap bridges physics/computation/information
  - For reader: understand what AQO can and cannot do, tools to analyze instances, know open questions
  - TODO: End with central insight
  - REVIEWER: presentation_quality - Strong closing

## On Writing

One must imagine the writer at work. The cycle is always the same: study, think, act, reflect, begin again. There are no shortcuts. To do something new, one must know the old intimately, and then be willing to betray it.

Writing is the act that makes the rest visible. A proof in a notebook changes nothing. A proof that others can follow changes the field. Good writing is about holding a conversation with the readers and nourishing them with perspective. The conversation is the questions they actually have. The nourishment is how your answers rearrange what they see.

A thesis is not a diary of labor. It is an experience designed to end in understanding. When it works, the reader finishes able to predict what happens when parameters shift, what breaks when assumptions weaken, where the real obstacles hide. This is the only honest measure: not what the writer did, but what the reader can now do.

Every thesis needs a spine --- a few questions that determine the order of everything else. Without this, you default to chronology or taxonomy: locally readable, globally dead. The difference between a thesis and a stack of results is the spine.

Before writing anything, write one page. Name the tension: what you want to prove and what obstructs you. State what is fixed and what you control. State the main results with explicit hypotheses. Say what changes because they hold. One sentence per chapter, naming its question. If you cannot write this page, the thesis does not exist yet. Writing the page forces the decision.

Then say the rules. What you will and will not do. Where you are headed. Readers who see the destination read proofs differently --- they allocate attention, forgive necessary detours, and recognize when you are stalling.

Build a skeleton before prose. Each chapter's question. The definitions its claims require. The theorems with hypotheses. The lemmas each theorem needs. Unused background means the story wandered.

Definitions come from failure. You try to state your goal and find the language insufficient. You introduce the smallest concept that clears the obstruction. Use it immediately. A definition that sits unused for pages arrived too early.

Exposition needs two passes. First explain plainly: what the statement means, what the parameters control, what the theorem lets you do that you could not do before. Then state and prove. The plain pass cannot be vague. Readers should be able to predict the scaling before seeing algebra.

A proof is not scratchwork but a guided path. State the strategy upfront. Decompose into lemmas matching logical moves, not algebraic accidents. Mark where the key inequalities enter. After proving, say what you actually used. Readers learn structure by seeing which assumptions bear weight.

Clarity is correctness. Ambiguous prose plants false theorems in the reader's mind. Short sentences. Write for intelligence that is not inside your head. A paragraph requiring rereading is not deep; it is unfinished. Rewriting is thinking.

Revise in passes. Structure: align the order of sections with the order of dependencies. Clarity: each paragraph advances the argument. Precision: replace vague words with explicit conditions. Style: cut scaffolding. If a sentence does no work, delete it.

Write out of order. Begin where you are surest. Introduction last. Written early, it promises what later chapters may not deliver.

Sometimes the spine does not hold. The proof stays broken. The theorem you wanted is false. This is not failure of effort but discovery of terrain. Document what you learned. The thesis that honestly maps a dead end serves the field better than the thesis that pretends the path was always clear.

Agents generate fast and err without grounding. They simulate understanding without possessing it. Asking for pages and hoping they are true is the fastest way to destroy a thesis. Give them artifacts: the one-page story, a theorem skeleton, claims paired with proofs. Feed sources and demand lifted statements, not invention. Require explicit assumptions, named failure modes, forward references. Reject "it is known" without pointers. You may outsource production. You cannot outsource judgment.

The only question that matters is what the reader can do afterward that they could not do before. When you doubt a section, ask this. If the answer is nothing, delete it. What remains after the cutting is the work. The cycle begins again.
