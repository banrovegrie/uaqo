In the circuit model of quantum computing, amplitude amplification techniques can be used to find solutions to NP-hard problems defined on _n_ -bits in
time poly( _n_ )2 _[n/]_ [2] . In this work, we investigate whether such general statements
can be made for adiabatic quantum optimization, as provable results regarding its performance are mostly unknown. Although a lower bound of Ω(2 _[n/]_ [2] )
has existed in such a setting for over a decade, a purely adiabatic algorithm
with this running time has been absent. We show that adiabatic quantum
optimization using an unstructured search approach results in a running time
that matches this lower bound (up to a polylogarithmic factor) for a broad
class of classical local spin Hamiltonians. For this, it is necessary to bound
the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic evolution and compute beforehand
the position of the avoided crossing with sufficient precision so as to adapt
the adiabatic schedule accordingly. However, we show that the position of the
avoided crossing is approximately given by a quantity that depends on the
degeneracies and inverse gaps of the problem Hamiltonian and is NP-hard to
compute even within a low additive precision. Furthermore, computing it exactly (or nearly exactly) is #P-hard. Our work indicates a possible limitation
of adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms, leaving open the question of
whether provable Grover-like speed-ups can be obtained for any optimization
problem using this approach.

### 1 Introduction

Adiabatic Quantum Computation (AQC) is an interesting, Hamiltonian-based alternative to the standard gate-based model of quantum computation [1, 2]. Being physically
motivated, this framework has deep connections to condensed matter physics [3, 4], to
complexity theory [5], and is also the zero temperature limit of quantum annealing [6].
In fact, AQC is a universal quantum computational model: the circuit and the adiabatic
models are equivalent up to a polynomial overhead [7]. Consequently, over the years, it has
been instrumental to the design of several novel quantum algorithms [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
Often, the adiabatic model also serves as a tool for developing quantum algorithms in the
circuit model [14, 15, 16, 17]: a discretized approximation of the adiabatic evolution can
be simulated in the gate model using standard techniques such as Hamiltonian simulation

[18] and phase randomization [19].
The underlying principle behind AQC is the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics

[20], an idea that is quite distinct from the circuit model. The computation starts from
the known ground state of an initial Hamiltonian _H_ 0, which is easy to prepare (usually
a product state). This Hamiltonian is then transformed “slowly” (adiabatically) into a
final Hamiltonian _HP_, whose ground states encapsulate the solution to the underlying
computational problem. The total Hamiltonian is an interpolation between the initial and
the final Hamiltonians, i.e. _H_ ( _s_ ) = (1 _−_ _s_ ) _H_ 0 + _sHP_, where _s_ : [0 _, T_ ] _�→_ [0 _,_ 1], known as the
adiabatic “ _schedule_ ”, determines the adiabatic path from _H_ 0 to _HP_, while _T_ is the total
time of evolution. The quantum adiabatic theorem guarantees that the final state has
a large overlap with the desired ground state, provided _T_ (which is also the algorithmic
running time) is at least a polynomial in the inverse of the minimum spectral gap of any
intermediate Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ) along the adiabatic path [20, 21].
Originally, AQC was formulated as a generic method for efficiently solving classically
hard optimization problems, known as adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO) [1, 2, 22].
Indeed, AQO provides a natural framework to solve NP-hard problems by finding the
minimum of a cost function encoded in the ground states of an _n_ -qubit Ising Hamiltonian

[23, 24]. Provable results about the performance of AQO in such settings are largely
unknown, as it becomes difficult to compute the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic
evolution. Exponential speedups are unlikely as for random instances of certain NP-hard
problems, exponentially small gaps appear, and the system gets stuck in one of the many
local minima, leading to a running time that can be slower than even classical brute force
search [25]. In this regard, a natural question to ask is whether it is possible to prove
at least a Grover-like speedup [26] over unstructured classical search approaches for the
problem of finding the global minimum of a cost function. Note that this is possible in the
circuit model: Grover’s algorithm (or more precisely, quantum amplitude amplification)
can be leveraged to find the minimum of a cost function encoded in any Ising Hamiltonian
in time Θ(2 _[n/]_ [2] poly( _n_ )) [27]. It is thus plausible to expect that such a generic result would
also be possible in the adiabatic setting, given that it is a universal model of quantum
computation. Moreover, in order to solve this problem, it is reasonable to assume that
all that should be required is access to an adiabatic quantum optimizer and a classical
computer, such that both are allowed to run for a time of at most _O_ (2 _[n/]_ [2] poly( _n_ )). How can
then such a general result be achieved in the context of AQO? Note that na¨ıvely encoding
a circuit model algorithm as an AQC already requires a polynomial overhead, erasing any
speed-up that is quadratic. To tackle this problem, it is thus natural to directly employ
the adiabatic version of Grover’s algorithm [26]. In the adiabatic setting, it is known
that the use of unstructured quantum search leads to a lower bound of Ω(2 _[n/]_ [2] ) for any

adiabatic algorithm [28]. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is unknown whether
any AQO algorithm can attain the aforementioned lower bound for finding ground states
of Hamiltonians encoding NP-hard problems. Indeed, as mentioned previously, this has
been an outstanding problem primarily because it is difficult to bound the spectral gap
throughout the adiabatic evolution, which is crucial for determining the running time of
any adiabatic algorithm.
In this work, we provide an adiabatic algorithm based on unstructured quantum search
that can find the minimum of an Ising Hamiltonian in time _O_ (2 _[n/]_ [2] poly( _n_ )), matching the
aforementioned lower bound (up to a factor of poly( _n_ )). The results are quite general: our
algorithm can find the minimum of any Hamiltonian that is diagonal in the computational
basis, provided it has a sufficiently large spectral gap. As with the adiabatic version of
Grover’s algorithm, there exists only a single avoided crossing between the two lowest
eigenstates of the adiabatic Hamiltonian. However, the overall spectrum is significantly
more complicated, and the position of the avoided crossing is non-trivial. Moreover, prior
knowledge of the position of this avoided crossing is crucial to constructing a local schedule
that is mindful of the instantaneous spectral gap of the time-dependent Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ):
the adiabatic algorithm uses this information in the adaptation of the adiabatic schedule,
which can be fast in regions of higher gap and slow in regions of smaller gap [29, 26]. We (i)
rigorously bound the spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ) for any _s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1], and (ii) derive a closed-form
expression that approximates the position of the avoided crossing with sufficient accuracy.
In fact, we demonstrate that it suffices for the approximation to be (roughly) within an
additive error of 2 _[−][n/]_ [2] of the actual position of the avoided crossing. Both (i) and (ii)
allow us to construct the appropriate local adiabatic schedule that leads to the optimal
running time.
As mentioned previously, in order to construct the optimal schedule, prior knowledge of
the position of the avoided crossing is crucial. Unlike the adiabatic version of Grover’s algorithm, the position of the avoided crossing is a function of the degeneracies and eigenvalue
gaps in the spectrum of the final Hamiltonian. We prove that it is hard to approximate
this quantity to even a precision that is much larger: any classical procedure that predicts
this quantity up to an additive precision of 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ) can be used as an oracle to solve
any problem in the complexity class NP, i.e. it is NP-hard. Indeed, we prove that only a
constant number of queries to such a classical algorithm is enough to solve the Boolean
satisfiability problem (in particular 3-SAT), a well-known NP-complete problem [30]. On
the other hand, estimating this quantity exactly (or nearly exactly, i.e. up to an additive
precision of 2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] ) is #P-hard. Recall that #P comprises of problems for which it is
possible to count the number of solutions in polynomial time, the counting analogue of NP

[31]. #P-hard (or #P-complete) problems are also notoriously difficult to solve, and this
has been leveraged to prove the hardness of sampling procedures at the heart of a number
proposals for demonstrating quantum advantage, namely Boson sampling [32], IQP sampling [33], and random circuit sampling [34, 35]. These complexity-theoretic reductions
prove that in order to optimally implement AQO, it is necessary to solve a computationally hard problem beforehand. It is thus unlikely that a generic classical algorithm will
approximate the position of the avoided crossing in _O_ (2 _[n/]_ [2] ) time.

[�]
This points to a fundamental limitation of the adiabatic framework, which is absent
in the circuit model. In the latter, it is possible to simply prepare the ground state of
the Ising Hamiltonian by starting from an initial equal superposition state and applying
standard techniques such as quantum phase estimation and amplitude amplification [36]
(modern techniques such as LCU [37, 38] or QSVT [39] to a block encoding of the underlying Hamiltonian [40] also works). Thus, our work leaves open the question of whether

this limitation may be overcome when one only has access to a device operating in the
adiabatic setting (along with a classical computer). More generally, can we develop a
purely adiabatic algorithm providing Grover-like speedups for the minimum finding problem without (i) needing access to a digital quantum computer and (ii) having to solve a
computationally hard problem in the process? This could be possible by a suitable modification of the adiabatic Hamiltonian (such as by adding extra qubits) or by introducing
intermediate Hamiltonians along the adiabatic path so that the position of the avoided
crossing does not depend on the spectrum of the problem Hamiltonian.
This article is organized as follows. In the rest of this section, we review some basic
definitions used in this article in Sec. 1.1, provide a brief overview of our results in Sec. 1.2,
and discuss related works in Sec. 1.3. In Sec. 2, we develop the adiabatic quantum algorithm for finding the minimum of a cost function encoded in an Ising Hamiltonian. We
keep our analysis general, as it holds for any Hamiltonian diagonal in the computational
basis (with a sufficiently large spectral gap). To this end, we bound the spectral gap of
the adiabatic Hamiltonian and find a closed-form expression approximating the position
of the avoided crossing in Sec. 2.2. In Sec. 2.3, we derive the algorithmic running time.
The computational hardness of predicting the position of the avoided crossing is discussed
in Sec. 3. Sec. 3.1 deals with proving that approximating this quantity to even a low precision is NP-hard while in Sec. 3.2, we show that (nearly) exactly estimating it is #P-hard.
Finally, we summarize our results and discuss possible open problems in Sec. 4


1.1 Preliminaries


In this section, we will briefly introduce some preliminary concepts that we will use in the
rest of this article. We begin by stating the notation we shall be using throughout the
article.


**Complexity theoretic notations:** Throughout the article, we shall be using the standard
complexity-theoretic notations. The _Big-O_ notation, _g_ ( _n_ ) = _O_ ( _f_ ( _n_ )) or _g_ ( _n_ ) _∈_ _O_ ( _f_ ( _n_ )),
implies that _g_ is upper bounded by _f_ . That is, there exists a constant _k >_ 0 and a
real number _n_ 0 such that _g_ ( _n_ ) _≤_ _k · f_ ( _n_ ) for all _n ≥_ _n_ 0. The _Big-Omega_ notation,
_g_ ( _n_ ) = Ω( _f_ ( _n_ )) (or equivalently _g_ ( _n_ ) _∈_ Ω( _f_ ( _n_ ))), implies _g_ ( _n_ ) _≥_ _kf_ ( _n_ ) ( _g_ is lower bounded
by _f_ ). The _Theta_ notation is used when _g_ is both bounded from above and below by _f_,
i.e. _g_ ( _n_ ) = Θ( _f_ ( _n_ )) (or _g_ ( _n_ ) _∈_ Θ( _f_ ( _n_ ))), if _g_ ( _n_ ) = _O_ ( _f_ ( _n_ )) and _g_ ( _n_ ) = Ω( _f_ ( _n_ )).
For each of these notations, it is standard to use _tilde_ ( _∼_ ) to hide polylogarithmic factors. For instance, _O_ ( _f_ ( _n_ )) = _O_ ( _f_ ( _n_ )polylog( _f_ ( _n_ ))). This applies to the other notations

[�]
as well. Often, we shall use the notation poly( _f_ ( _n_ )) to denote a function that is some
polynomial of _f_ ( _n_ ).


**Norm:** Unless otherwise specified _∥A∥_ will denote the spectral norm of operator _A_ while
_∥|v⟩−|u⟩∥_ will denote the _ℓ_ 2-norm distance between quantum states _|v⟩_ and _|u⟩_ .


**Resolvent of an operator:** For all _γ ∈_ C and normal operators _A_ (which include the
self-adjoint operators), the distance between _γ_ and the closest point in the spectrum of _A_
is given by _∥RA_ ( _γ_ ) _∥_ _[−]_ [1], where


_RA_ ( _γ_ ) := ( _γ · I −_ _A_ ) _[−]_ [1] _,_ (1)


is the resolvent and _I_ is the identity operator.

**Sherman-Morrison formula:** Suppose _A ∈_ C _[N]_ _[×][N]_ is an invertible square matrix and _|u⟩_ _, |v⟩∈_
C _[N]_ are column vectors such that 1+ _⟨v| A_ _[−]_ [1] _|u⟩̸_ = 0. Then, the Sherman-Morrison formula

[41] states the following:


( _A_ + _|u⟩⟨v|_ ) _[−]_ [1] = _A_ _[−]_ [1] _−_ _[A][−]_ [1] _[|][u][⟩⟨][v][|][A][−]_ [1] (2)

1 + _⟨v| A_ _[−]_ [1] _|u⟩_


Next, we discuss some complexity classes that are crucial for our results, while we refer
the readers to Ref. [42] for details. We begin by defining the class NP:


**The complexity class** NP **:** The complexity class NP is the set of decision problems (with
a 0 _/_ 1 output) for which the output can be verified efficiently (in polynomial time). An
equivalent definition is that a problem is in NP if a non-deterministic Turing machine
decides the problem in polynomial time. It can be formally defined as follows:


**Definition 1.** _The complexity class_ NP _is the set of all problems that are decided by a_
_non-deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine._


Interestingly, there is a subset of problems in NP that are at least as hard as any other
problem in the class. These are the so-called NP-hard problems. Indeed, any problem in
NP can be efficiently reduced to a NP-hard problem. Moreover, if it can be established that
a given NP-hard problem also belongs to the class NP, then it is NP-complete. Classical
computers are not expected to solve NP-hard (or NP-complete) problems efficiently. Next,
we define the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, which is arguably the most famous
NP-complete problem:


**The 3-** SAT **problem:** The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem can be stated as follows: given a Boolean formula _F_, does there exist an assignment of truth values (0 _/_ 1) to
the variables of _F_, so that _F_ evaluates to true? This is a decision problem, i.e. given a
formula as an input, the algorithm is supposed to output a binary (0/1) answer. In the
most common version of this problem, the formula _F_ is comprised of multiple clauses, with
each clause containing some fixed number of Boolean variables and their negations (known
as literals), separated by Boolean ORs (denoted by _∨_ ). The clauses are joined together
by Boolean AND (denoted by _∧_ ). Then k-SAT refers to satisfiability problems where
there are exactly _k_ literals per clause (for 3-SAT, we have _k_ = 3). The satisfiability problem, and in particular 3-SAT, was the first problem in NP, proven to be NP-complete [30].


**The complexity class** #P **:** The class #P, introduced by Valiant [43, 31], can be seen
as the counting analogue of NP. For problems in NP, for any given input, we ask whether
there is a solution, i.e. the output is binary (0 _/_ 1) (decision problem). On the other hand,
in the case of counting problems, for any given input, the output is a natural number
denoting the number of solutions. We formally state the definition of this class below:


**Definition 2.** _The complexity class_ #P _is the set of all functions f_ : _{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_ _[∗]_ _�→_ N _such_
_that there is a non-deterministic polynomial-time Turing Machine M such that for all_
_x ∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_ _[∗]_ _, f_ ( _x_ ) _denotes the number of accepting branches of M_ _._


Much like NP it is possible to analogously define the complexity classes #P-hard and
#P-complete. Problems in this class are also hard for a classical computer to solve efficiently. For instance, #3-SAT (the counting version of 3-SAT) asks for the number of
satisfying assignments in a given Boolean formula and is known to be #P-complete.

**Adiabatic Quantum Computation:** AQC is an interpolation between two _n_ -qubit Hamiltonians, _H_ 0 and _HP_, such that the evolution is governed by the time-dependent Hamiltonian


_H_ ( _s_ ) = (1 _−_ _s_ ) _H_ 0 + _sHP,_


where _s_ ( _t_ ) : [0 _, T_ ] _→_ [0 _,_ 1] is a monotonic function referred to as the adiabatic “schedule”

[4]. The system begins in the ground state of _H_ 0, which is unique and typically easy to
prepare (such as a product state) and evolves (adiabatically) over a long enough time _T_
such that, by the end of the evolution, the final state is _ε_ -close to the ground state of _HP_ .
The precise meaning of “a long enough time” _T_ is captured by the rigorous version of the
quantum adiabatic theorem [20, 21]. We state the following result from Ref. [20] in the
finite-dimensional case:


**Lemma 3** (Adiabatic Theorem, Theorem 3 of Ref. [20]) **.** _Suppose H_ ( _s_ ) _is a Hamiltonian_
_with a bounded norm that is twice differentiable (denoted by H_ _[′]_ ( _s_ ) _and H_ _[′′]_ ( _s_ ) _respectively)._
_Consider a closed system evolving under H_ ( _s_ ) _given by_


_i_ _∂_

_such that |ψ_ (0) _⟩_ _is a ground state of H_ (0) = _H_ 0 _and_ 0 _≤_ _s ≤_ 1 _, and T is the total evolution_

_of H_ ( _s_ ) _, which has degeneracy d, and g_ ( _s_ ) _be the spectral gap of H_ ( _s_ ) _. Then, there exists_
_a constant C >_ 0 _such that the quantum adiabatic theorem satisfies_

This lemma provides a precise lower bound on the total evolution time _T_ of the underlying AQC. If, at the end of the adiabatic evolution, we wish to end up in a state that
is _ε_ -close in trace distance to the underlying ground states, it is enough to make sure that
_ν_ [2] (1) = _ε_, which can be achieved by choosing some _T_ which is a polynomial in the inverse
of the minimum spectral gap of any intermediate Hamiltonian along the adiabatic path,
and a polynomial in 1 _/ε_ . That is,

In Sec. C, we develop a version of the adiabatic theorem, which requires fewer assumptions
on the adiabatic Hamiltonian and is simpler to analyze. We leverage these results to derive
the running time of AQO. We also make the polynomial dependence on the gap and the
error more precise.


**Adiabatic Quantum Optimization:** AQO provides a natural framework to solve hard classical optimization problems, which was the original motivation behind the adiabatic model
of quantum computation [2]. The task involves finding the minimum of a cost function
encoded in an _n_ -qubit local classical spin Hamiltonian (such as the Ising spin glass Hamiltonian). As mentioned previously, adiabatic quantum optimization involves evolving the

time-dependent Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ) = (1 _−_ _s_ ) _H_ 0 + _sHP_ from the ground state of _H_ 0 to
the ground state of the problem Hamiltonian _HP_, for a total time _T_ according to the
schedule _s_ : [0 _, T_ ] _�→_ [0 _,_ 1]. Since we are interested in solving optimization problems via
unstructured adiabatic search, the initial Hamiltonian


_H_ 0 = _−|ψ_ 0 _⟩⟨ψ_ 0 _|,_


where _|ψ_ 0 _⟩_ = _|_ + _⟩_ _[⊗][n]_, is the equal superposition over all computational basis states [26, 28].
For the problem Hamiltonian, we consider any _n_ -qubit Hamiltonian diagonal _Hz_ that is
diagonal in the computational basis. Without loss of generality, we assume that _Hz_ is
appropriately rescaled and normalized such that its eigenvalues lie in [0 _,_ 1]. Suppose the
spectral decomposition of
_Hz_ =             - _Ez |z⟩⟨z|,_

_z∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_ _[n]_


where _Ez_ is the eigenvalue and _|z⟩_ is the corresponding eigenvector. Suppose that _Hz_ has
_M_ distinct eigenlevels with eigenvalues 0 _≤_ _E_ 0 _< E_ 1 _< . . . < EM_ _−_ 1 _≤_ 1, such that energy
level with eigenvalue _Ek_ is _dk_ -degenerate. Formally, for 0 _≤_ _k ≤_ _M −_ 1, we define a set of
bit-strings
Ω _k_ = _{z | z ∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_ _[n]_ _, Hz |z⟩_ = _Ek |z⟩},_

such that _|_ Ω _k|_ = _dk_ is the degeneracy of eigenvalue _Ek_ and [�] _k_ _[d][k]_ [= 2] _[n]_ [ =] _[ N]_ [. Furthermore,]
we require that our problem Hamiltonians satisfy a certain spectral condition. For this,
we define the following spectral functions of the problem Hamiltonian:



_Ap_ = [1]

_N_



_M_ _−_ 1



_k_ =1



_dk_

_[,]_ where _p ∈_ N _._ (3)
( _Ek −_ _E_ 0) ~~_[p]_~~



These parameters, which are functions of inverse eigenvalue gaps and degeneracies of the
spectrum of the problem Hamiltonian, will also become important for (i) predicting the
position of the avoided crossing, (ii) determining the algorithmic running time, and (iii)
proving hardness results.


1.2 Summary of our results


In this section, we state the main results of this work and outline the techniques central
to their derivation. We begin by formally defining the class of problem Hamiltonians _Hz_
for which our results hold.


**Definition 4** (The problem Hamiltonian) **.** _Let N_ = 2 _[n]_ _, and c ≪_ 1 _is a small enough_
_positive constant._ _We consider any N × N Hamiltonian Hz that is diagonal in the_

0 _≤_ _E_ 0 _< E_ 1 _< · · · EM_ _−_ 1 _≤_ 1 _such that the eigenlevel corresponding to eigenvalue Ek is_
_dk-degenerate, where each dk is a non-negative integer satisfying_ [�] _k_ _[M]_ =0 _[−]_ [1] _[d][k]_ [ =] _[ N]_ _[. Addi-]_
_tionally, if_ ∆= _E_ 1 _−_ _E_ 0 _is the spectral gap and A_ 2 _is as defined in Eq._ (3) _, we require that_
_the following condition holds for the spectrum of Hz:_

The overall adiabatic Hamiltonian is then defined as

Note that _Hz_ encompasses a large family of classical local spin Hamiltonians. The spectral
condition is satisfied by any _Hz_ with a large enough spectral gap. Indeed, observe that

Appendix that choosing _c ≈_ 0 _._ 02 suffices (See Sec. A).
It is well known that solutions to NP-Hard problems can be encoded into the ground
states of the problem Hamiltonians we consider. More concretely, consider the 2-local
classical Ising model Hamiltonian _Hσ_ of _n_ -qubits as follows



_Hσ_ = - _Jijσz_ _[i]_ _[σ]_ _z_ _[j]_ [+]

_⟨i,j⟩_



_n_

- _hjσz_ _[j]_ (6)

_j_ =1



where _Jij, hj ∈{−m, −_ _m_ + 1 _, . . .,_ 0 _,_ 1 _, . . ., m −_ 1 _, m}_ for some constant positive
integer _m ∈_ Θ(1). There are _M_ distinct eigenvalues of _Hσ_, all of which are integers
and _M ∈_ poly( _n_ ). This is the quantum version of Ising spin glass Hamiltonians, and
solutions to several NP-hard (or NP-complete) problems can be encoded in the ground
states of _Hσ_ . In fact, for some NP-complete problems such as Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) or MaxCut, the encoding is straightforward, with very little
overhead on _n_ . For details, we refer the readers to Refs. [23, 24]. Note that the normalized
version of _Hσ_ satisfies the conditions outlined in Definition 4. In particular, it has a spectral
gap ∆ _≥_ 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ), which, combined with the lower bound on the quantity _A_ 2, ensures
that the condition in Eq. (4) holds. Nevertheless, we shall keep our analysis general as
it works for a broader class of local spin Hamiltonians. We shall invoke particular cases
(such as the classical Ising Hamiltonian) only when necessary.
The AQO algorithm we consider starts from _|ψ_ 0 _⟩_ (the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian) and adiabatically evolves into a quantum state that has a fidelity of at least 1 _−_ _ε_
with the ground states of _Hz_ . Much like the adiabatic version of Grover’s algorithm, having a one-dimensional projector as the initial Hamiltonian ensures that the spectrum of
the _H_ ( _s_ ) has only a single avoided crossing between the ground and the first excited state.
However, the position of this avoided crossing is non-trivial in our case and depends on the
spectrum of the problem Hamiltonian _Hz_ . Moreover, the spectrum is complicated by the
presence of avoided crossings between the higher excited states, which makes it challenging
to bound the spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ) (denoted by _g_ ( _s_ )) throughout the adiabatic evolution.
As mentioned previously, this is precisely why, in such settings, generic provable speedups
over classical unstructured search have been absent.
In Sec. 2.2, we provide an approximation of the position of the avoided crossing between
the ground and the first excited states. This involves (a) finding the point where the
spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ) is minimum, (b) identifying a narrow window of _s_, in which the
spectral gap scales similarly to the minimum gap, and (c) proving that the spectral gap
is at least as large outside this window. Indeed, we prove that the position of the avoided
crossing is well approximated by

The spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ) (denoted by _g_ ( _s_ )) remains close to the minimum gap within a
small window _δs_ around _s_ _[∗]_ (See inset Fig. 1). That is, the actual position of the avoided
crossing is within the interval _Is_ _[∗]_ = [ _s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _δs, s_ _[∗]_ + _δs_ ], where

such that _|ψ_ 0 _⟩_ is an equal superposition of all computational basis states of _n_ qubits. The final
Hamiltonian _Hz_ is diagonal in the computational basis such that there are 11 distinct eigenenergies
_Ek_, equally spaced between 0 and 1. Each eigenvalue _Ek_ is _dk_ -degenerate, where the degeneracies
are distributed according to a Gaussian probability distribution. The vertical dotted line (red) denotes
the position of the avoided crossing between the ground and the first excited state. The inset figure
isolates the two lowest eigenstates of _H_ ( _s_ ) from the rest of the spectrum and zooms into the region
of the avoided crossing. As described in the article, the region of the avoided crossing corresponds
to a window of width _δs_ on either side of _s_ _[∗]_ . The ground and the first excited states are given by
_λ_ 0( _s_ ) = _sE_ 0 + _δ_ 0 [+][(] _[s]_ [)][, and] _[ λ]_ [1][(] _[s]_ [) =] _[ sE]_ [0][ +] _[ δ]_ 0 _[−]_ [(] _[s]_ [)][, with the gap between these eigenstates scaling as]
_g_ min, which is also the minimum spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ).



Thus, for any _s ∈Is_ _[∗]_, the spectral gap of the Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ), satisfies _g_ ( _s_ ) = _O_ ( _g_ min),

is the minimum spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ).
Outside this window, we define the intervals: (i) _Is_ _[←]_ = [0 _, s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _δs_ ), and (ii) _Is_ _[→]_ =
( _s_ _[∗]_ + _δs,_ 1]. We use different techniques for each of these regions to obtain lower bounds
on the spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ). To the left of the avoided crossing, i.e. for any _s ∈Is_ _[←]_, we
use the fact that for any ansatz _|ϕ⟩_ (of unit norm), the variational principle ensures that
the ground energy _λ_ 0( _s_ ) _≤⟨ϕ|H_ ( _s_ ) _|ϕ⟩_ . We come up with a non-trivial ansatz such that
this quantity is a tight upper bound on the ground energy (See Fig. 2). Furthermore, we
show that _sE_ 0 is a good lower bound for the energy of the first excited state. These two
bounds combined allow us to obtain a tight lower bound on _g_ ( _s_ ) in this whole region. This
enables us to prove that

The same technique does not yield a tight bound on _g_ ( _s_ ) to the right of the avoided
crossing, as the spectrum is significantly more complicated (see Fig. 1). Indeed, it is
considerably more challenging to obtain a tight bound on _g_ ( _s_ ) here. We consider a line

to the left and the right of the avoided crossing. We employ different techniques to bound the gap in
each of these regions.
_Left of the avoided crossing region:_ We obtain an upper bound on the ground energy _λ_ 0( _s_ ) and a
lower bound on the energy of the first excited state, _λ_ 1( _s_ ). We consider an ansatz _|ϕ⟩_ and use the
variational principle to upper bound the ground energy _λ_ 0( _s_ ) _≤⟨ϕ|H_ ( _s_ ) _|ϕ⟩_ (depicted by pink dotted
lines). Additionally, _λ_ 1( _s_ ) is lower bounded by _sE_ 0, which is depicted by a black horizontal dotted line.
_Right of the avoided crossing region:_ We consider a straight line (dark red dotted lines) from _s_ = _s_ _[∗]_ to
some value between the two lowest eigenvalues of the problem Hamiltonian ( _E_ 0 and _E_ 1, respectively).
The line _γ_ ( _s_ ) is offset by a non-trivial amount at _s_ = _s_ _[∗]_ and its slope is carefully adjusted to obtain a
tight bound on _g_ ( _s_ ) in this region.


_γ_ ( _s_ ) that lies between the lowest and the second lowest eigenvalues of _H_ ( _s_ ) and show
that the spectrum is at least a certain distance from this line by considering the resolvent
of _H_ ( _s_ ) (see Eq. (1)). More precisely, as shown in Fig. 2, _γ_ ( _s_ ) is offset by a non-trivial
amount from _sE_ 0 (the offset is precisely the quantity _kg_ min, for some constant _k <_ 1)
at _s_ = _s_ _[∗]_ and linearly interpolates between this point and an appropriately chosen value
between _E_ 0 and _E_ 1 (say _E_ 0 + _a_, with _a <_ ∆), for _s_ = 1. That is, _γ_ ( _s_ ) = _sE_ 0 + _β_ ( _s_ ), where

Here _a_ determines the slope of the line _γ_ ( _s_ ) and _β_ (1) = _a <_ ∆. Both _a_ and _k_ are carefully
tuned to obtain a tight lower bound on _g_ ( _s_ ) in this region. Indeed, for any _s ≥_ _s_ _[∗]_, we
consider _RH_ ( _s_ )( _γ_ ), the resolvent of _H_ ( _s_ ) with respect to _γ_ ( _s_ ), and estimate an upper bound

on ��� _RH_ ( _s_ )��� using the Sherman-Morrison formula (See Eq. (2)). The distance between the

_−_ 1
line _γ_ ( _s_ ) and the spectrum of _H_ ( _s_ ) is then given by the quantity ��� _RH_ ( _s_ )��� . Finally, we
leverage the fact that the spectral gap _g_ ( _s_ ) is at least twice the minimum distance of _γ_ ( _s_ )
from the spectrum of _H_ ( _s_ ), i.e.

This allows us to bound the gap to the right of the avoided crossing as

_g_ ( _s_ ) _≥_ (11)

for some function _f_ ( _s_ ). We rigorously establish that the choices _k_ = 1 _/_ 4, and _a_ = 4 _k_ [2] ∆ _/_ 3
ensure that monotonically _f_ is a decreasing function in the interval _s ∈_ [ _s_ _[∗]_ _,_ 1], such that
its maximum value _f_ ( _s_ _[∗]_ ) = Θ(1). In fact, this enables us to obtain a simple bound on the
gap for any _s ∈_ [ _s_ _[∗]_ _,_ 1], given by

Since our choice of _β_ ensures that _β_ ( _s_ _[∗]_ ) _≥_ _kg_ min, the gap can be lower bounded as
_g_ ( _s_ ) _≥_ _O_ ( _g_ min) in the entire interval of _s ∈_ [ _s_ _[∗]_ _,_ 1], including in _Is_ _[→]_ . From these bounds,


Figure 3: Comparison of the actual gap of the adiabatic Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ) (denoted by _g_ ( _s_ )) in the
article and the lower bounds we obtained for a subset of the interval _s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1]. The line above (blue)
denotes the true value of _g_ ( _s_ ) for a 20-qubit adiabatic Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ) = _−_ (1 _−_ _s_ ) _|ψ_ 0 _⟩⟨ψ_ 0 _|_ + _sHz_
with _s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1]. Here, _|ψ_ 0 _⟩_ is the equal superposition of all 20-qubit computational basis states, while
the problem Hamiltonian _Hz_ is diagonal in the computational basis. _Hz_ has 11 distinct eigenvalues _Ek_
such each _Ek_ is _dk_ -degenerate. The degeneracies are distributed according to a Gaussian probability
distribution. As described in the article, we divide _s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1] into three intervals and obtain bounds on
the gap using different techniques in each interval. The line below corresponds to our lower bound on
_g_ ( _s_ ): to the left of the avoided crossing region (in red), the region of the avoided crossing (in green),
and to the right of the avoided crossing (dark pink).


we are able to prove that _g_ ( _s_ ) is minimum in the vicinity of the avoided crossing (i.e. for
_s ∈Is_ _[∗]_ ) and larger outside this window. A comparison between the true value of _g_ ( _s_ ) and
our lower bounds in each of the three intervals is shown in Fig. 3. Obtaining tight bounds
on the spectral gap for any _s_, (i) allows us to construct the optimal local schedule, and
(ii) apply the adiabatic theorem. It is well known, following Refs. [29, 26] that a local
schedule is necessary for obtaining optimal running times in adiabatic algorithms. Such
a schedule requires information about the scaling of the gap as a function of _s_, ensuring
that the evolution is slower in regions where the gap is small. In this regard, we present
an extension of the recent result of Ref. [44] on quantum phase randomization to the

continuous-time (adiabatic) setting. This allows us to develop a simplified version of the
adiabatic theorem that is quite general and requires minimal assumptions on _H_ ( _s_ ): it
holds for any bounded, twice differentiable Hamiltonian with a known lower bound on its
gap _g_ ( _s_ ). We are able to obtain a generic expression for the running time of any adiabatic
algorithm under a local adaptive schedule whose derivative scales with _g_ ( _s_ ). In Sec. 2.3,
we apply these bounds in the context of AQO, in conjunction with the bounds obtained
for _g_ ( _s_ ), to obtain a closed-form expression on the running time _T_, which matches the
lower bound of [28] (up to a polylogarithmic overhead) for a broad class of Hamiltonians.
We summarize our findings via the following theorem:


**Theorem 5** (Main result 1: Running time of AQO) **.** _Let ε ∈_ [0 _,_ 1) _and consider the_

The algorithmic running time in Theorem 5 is optimal up to polylog factors for any Ising
Hamiltonian _Hσ_ with a spectral gap ∆ _>_ 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ) (as defined in Eq. (6)). This is
because, for these Hamiltonians, both _A_ 1 and _A_ 2 are lower bounded by a constant and
upper bounded by _O_ (poly( _n_ )), leading to a running time of _O_ [�] (�2 ~~_[n]_~~ _/d_ 0), which is optimal

in this setting.
We observe that this generic quantum speedup over brute-force search comes with
caveats. Note that to run the AQO algorithm, we need to construct the appropriate
local schedule (whose derivative scales with the gap _g_ ( _s_ )). For this, we argue that prior
knowledge of the position of the avoided crossing is required to an additive precision of
_O_ ( _δs_ ). This, in turn, necessitates the estimation of the spectral parameter _A_ 1 prior to
the running of the adiabatic algorithm. Additionally, the time required to compute this
quantity should be no more than the running time _T_ of the adiabatic algorithm.
In Sec. 3, we rigorously investigate how difficult it is to compute the position of the
avoided crossing (which boils down to estimating _A_ 1). More precisely, suppose we have
access to an adiabatic quantum optimizer and a classical computing device. Then, what
is the computational hardness of exactly, and subsequently, approximately estimating _A_ 1?
We prove that it is NP-hard to approximate _A_ 1 even to within an additive precision of
1 _/_ poly( _n_ ) (which is much larger than the desired accuracy) in Sec. 3.1. To this end, we
consider Boolean satisfiability (more precisely, 3-SAT), a well-known NP-complete problem. This problem asks if a given Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment, and solving
it reduces to whether we can disambiguate between two promised thresholds of the ground
energy of a 3-local Hamiltonian _H_ . We are able to prove that it is possible to distinguish
between these two thresholds of the ground energy by making only two calls to any classical algorithm that estimates _A_ 1 to an additive accuracy of 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ). Our proof involves
modifying the Hamiltonian _H_ by coupling an extra spin and then querying the classical

algorithm to estimate _A_ 1 for the modified Hamiltonian. Formally, we state the following
lemma, which we prove in Sec. 3.1:


**Theorem 6** (Main Result 2: Hardness of approximately estimating _A_ 1) **.** _Let ε ∈_ (0 _,_ 1) _._
_Suppose there exists a classical procedure Cε_ ( _⟨H⟩_ ) _that accepts as input, the description of_

_Then, it is possible to solve the_ 3 _-_ SAT _problem by making only two calls to Cε, provided_

_ε <_ [1]

72 _[·]_ _n −_ 1 _[.]_


In addition to this, we prove in Sec. 3.2, that estimating _A_ 1 exactly (or nearly exactly,
i.e., to within an accuracy of 2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] ) is as hard as solving any problem in #P, i.e. it
is #P-hard. For this, consider a classical procedure _C_ that exactly estimates _A_ 1, then
we show that it is possible to extract the degeneracies _dk_ in the spectrum of the Ising
Hamiltonian _Hσ_ using only _O_ (poly( _n_ )) calls to _C_ . Once again, we modify _Hσ_ by adding
an extra spin qubit of a certain local energy and use _C_ to estimate _A_ 1 for this modified
Hamiltonian. By varying this local energy term of the additional spin, we estimate _A_ 1
for _O_ (poly( _n_ )) different values, requiring only _O_ (poly( _n_ )) calls to _C_ . By using standard
polynomial interpolation techniques, we are able to construct a polynomial from which
the degeneracies _dk_ of _Hσ_ can be extracted exactly.
Recall that solutions to NP-hard problems can be encoded in the ground states of
_Hσ_, including 3-SAT. The counting version of this problem (#3-SAT) asks the number of
satisfying assignments of a given Boolean formula and is #P-complete. This is equivalent
to extracting the degeneracy of the ground state _d_ 0, of _Hσ_ . Thus, our reduction proves
that computing _A_ 1 exactly is #P-hard. This result is robust to sufficiently small errors in
the approximation of _A_ 1. That is, the problem remains #P-hard as long as _C_ estimates
_A_ 1 to within an accuracy of _ε ∈_ _O_ (2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] ). It can also be extended to the setting where
_C_ is probabilistic. We summarize the results via the following theorem which we prove in
Sec. 3.2:


**Theorem 7** (Main Result 3: Hardness of (nearly) exactly estimating _A_ 1) **.** _Suppose_
_there exists a classical algorithm C_ ( _⟨H⟩_ ) _which accepts as input the description of an_
_n-qubit Hamiltonian H, and outputs A_ 1 _exactly, or with an accuracy of ε such that ε ∈_
_O_ (2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] ) _. Furthermore, suppose Hσ be the n-qubit Ising Hamiltonian (with appropriate_
_parameter ranges, as defined in Eq._ (6) _), such that its eigenenergies are E_ 0 _< E_ 1 _< · · · Ek,_
_where_ 0 _≤_ _k ≤_ _M −_ 1 _, with known gaps_ ∆ _k_ = _Ek −_ _E_ 0 _. Then for all k ∈_ [0 _, M −_ 1] _, it is_
_possible to estimate the degeneracy dk of energy eigenvalue Ek by making O_ (poly( _n_ )) _calls_
_to C._


Overall, our results demonstrate that the optimality of AQO is contingent on solving a
computationally hard problem a priori. As discussed earlier, this points to a fundamental
limitation of the framework of AQO, which is absent in the circuit model, and we leave
open the question of whether this can be circumvented without requiring access to a digital
quantum computer.


1.3 Related Work


As discussed previously, the question we ask in this paper is whether a generic quadratic
speedup over classical brute force search can be obtained to solve computationally hard

problems using AQO. For this, we consider _H_ ( _s_ ) to be a linear interpolation between a
one-dimensional projector and a problem Hamiltonian that is diagonal in the standard
basis (such as a classical Ising spin Hamiltonian) with a large enough spectral gap. In
Ref. [45], using a combination of analytical and heuristic arguments, the authors showed
that the minimum spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ) is exponentially small for the 3-SAT problem (it
scales roughly as - _d_ 0 _/_ 2 ~~_[n]_~~, where _d_ 0 is the number of solutions), and also provided an

expression for the position of the avoided crossing. However, a rigorous analysis of the
algorithmic runtime was absent. Hen [46] showed that unstructured adiabatic search can
achieve a quadratic speedup for a particular random classical problem Hamiltonian, with a
specific distribution of energies. However, the analysis therein is simplified by the specific
choice of the problem Hamiltonian which ensures that the position of the avoided crossing
does not depend on its spectrum.
The behavior of the spectrum of interpolated Hamiltonians (such as the _H_ ( _s_ ) we
consider) in the vicinity of an avoided crossing has been studied very soon after the first
version of the adiabatic theorem [47]. We refer the readers to Ref. [48] for an exposition
of these early results. However, such techniques do not yield tight bounds for the gap,
away from the avoided crossing. In our work, we manage to obtain tight bounds on the
spectral gap for any _s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1] by using a variety of techniques, namely (i) the variational
principle, (ii) methods used in the context of continuous-time quantum walks [49, 50, 51],
and (iii) the Sherman-Morrison formula [41]. We also develop a simplified version of the
adiabatic theorem, which requires fewer assumptions than the prior art [20]. This extends
the recent work of Ref. [44] to the continuous-time setting. Our general results can be
used to obtain the time after which adiabatically evolving a state under Hamiltonian
_H_ ( _s_ ) with a local schedule results in a state having a high fidelity with the ground state of
_H_ (1). These methods are more broadly applicable, and the details of the same will appear
elsewhere [52]. Here, we obtain upper bounds on the running time of AQO by applying
the aforementioned results.

### 2 Optimal adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm


In this Section, we rigorously derive the bounds on the spectral gap of the adiabatic
Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ) and present the overall algorithm in detail. We begin by showing that
it suffices to consider _H_ ( _s_ ) restricted to an _M_ -dimensional symmetric subspace (which it
leaves invariant) and also derive expressions for the relevant eigenvalues and eigenstates.


2.1 Spectrum of the adiabatic Hamiltonian


We begin by briefly recapping some of the details on the adiabatic Hamiltonian and the
problem Hamiltonians we consider, as discussed in Sec. 1.1. The overall adiabatic Hamiltonian we have is given by


_H_ ( _s_ ) = _−_ (1 _−_ _s_ ) _|ψ_ 0 _⟩⟨ψ_ 0 _|_ + _sHz,_


where _|ψ_ 0 _⟩_ is the equal superposition of all _N_ = 2 _[n]_ computational basis states, and _Hz_
is the problem Hamiltonian, satisfying Definition 4. Recall from Definition 4 that the
_n_ -qubit problem Hamiltonian _Hz_ is diagonal in the computational basis, with _M_ distinct
eigenlevels with eigenvalues 0 _≤_ _E_ 0 _< E_ 1 _< . . . < EM_ _−_ 1 _≤_ 1, such that energy level with
eigenvalue _Ek_ is _dk_ -degenerate. Formally, for 0 _≤_ _k ≤_ _M −_ 1, we define a set of bit-strings


Ω _k_ = _{z | z ∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_ _[n]_ _, Hz |z⟩_ = _Ek |z⟩},_

such that _|_ Ω _k|_ = _dk_ is the degeneracy of eigenvalue _Ek_ and [�] _k_ _[d][k]_ [= 2] _[n]_ [ =] _[ N]_ [.]
Let us denote the _N_ -dimensional Hilbert space corresponding to _H_ ( _s_ ) as _H_ . In this section we show that the spectrum of _H_ ( _s_ ) has two mutually orthogonal invariant subspaces,
i.e. _H_ = _HS ⊕HS_ _[⊥]_ [such that][ dim(] _[H][S]_ [) =] _[ M]_ [ and][ dim(] _[H]_ _S_ _[⊥]_ [) =] _[ N][ −]_ _[M]_ [. We will first define]
an _M_ dimensional symmetric subspace _HS_, comprising of non-degenerate eigenlevels of
_Hz_ as follows:
_HS_ = span _{|k⟩|_ 0 _≤_ _k ≤_ _M −_ 1 _},_ (13)

where _|k⟩_ = ~~_√_~~ 1 _dk_ - _z∈_ Ω _k_ _[|][z][⟩]_ [. Then, we can re-write]

i.e. _|ψ_ 0 _⟩∈HS_ . Thus, the total Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ) leaves the subspace _HS_ invariant and

Let us now fix a basis for the complement of _HS_, which we refer to as _HS_ _[⊥]_ [. For every]
_k ∈_ [0 _, M −_ 1], let us order the bit strings in Ω _k_ as _zk_ [(] _[ℓ][′]_ [)], where 1 _≤_ _ℓ_ _[′]_ _≤|_ Ω _k|_ = _dk_ . Then,
for all _k ∈_ [0 _, M −_ 1] and _ℓ_ _∈_ [0 _, dk −_ 1], define the Fourier basis

We now turn our attention to the eigenvalues of _H_ ( _s_ ). Since _H_ ( _s_ ) is the sum of a rank
one projector and a Hermitian matrix, its eigenvalues, _λ_ ( _s_ ), can be succinctly expressed

[53]. We have the following lemma:


**Lemma 8.** _Suppose H_ ( _s_ ) _is the adiabatic Hamiltonian defined in Eq._ (5) _. Then λ_ ( _s_ ) _is_
_an eigenvalue of H_ ( _s_ ) _if and only if, either λ_ ( _s_ ) = _sEk or_

Now consider the _M_ dimensional symmetric subspace _HS_ . As discussed previously,
this space is spanned by the states _|k⟩_, where _k ∈_ [0 _, M −_ 1]. For now, let us denote by
_H_ ¯ ( _s_ ), the Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ) restricted to this invariant subspace, as defined in Eq. (14).
We begin by finding the conditions for _|ψ⟩_ to be an eigenstate of _H_ [¯] ( _s_ ) with eigenvalue
_λ_ ( _s_ ). That is,



_|ψ⟩_ =



_M_ _−_ 1

- _αk |k⟩_ _,_ (17)

_k_ =0



where [�] _k_ _[|][α][k][|]_ [2][ = 1. Then, as]
_Hz |k⟩_ = _Ek |k⟩_ _,_ (18)


for all 0 _≤_ _k ≤_ _M −_ 1, we have,


_H_ ¯ ( _s_ ) _|ψ⟩_ = _s_      - _Ekαk |k⟩−_ (1 _−_ _s_ ) _γ |ψ_ 0 _⟩_ = _λ |ψ⟩_ _,_ (19)

_k∈_ [ _M_ ]


where, we have assumed _γ_ = _⟨ψ_ 0 _|ψ⟩_ . Now, expressing _|ψ⟩_ as in Eq. (17), and comparing
each term, yields that for any 0 _≤_ _k ≤_ _M −_ 1,

Since, _γ_ = _⟨ψ_ 0 _|ψ⟩_ = (1 _/_ _N_ ) [�] _k∈_ [ _M_ ] _[α][k]_ _dk_, we can substitute the expression for _αk_

This provides the conditions for _λ_ ( _s_ ) to be an eigenvalue of _H_ [¯] ( _s_ ). Observe that the right
hand side of this equation is a monotonically decreasing function of _λ_ within each interval
( _sEk−_ 1 _, sEk_ ), with _λ_ = _sEk_ being the poles. This ensures each of these intervals, including
the interval ( _−∞, sE_ 0) has exactly one solution. Thus, overall there are _M_ solutions to
this equation, and hence _M_ eigenvalues _λ_ ( _s_ ), corresponding to eigenstates in _HS_ .


Although Eq. (22) allows us to assign an interval to each eigenvalue, it is not straightforward to extract analytical bounds on the spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ). Indeed, by observing
that the two lowest eigenvalues satisfy _λ_ 0( _s_ ) _∈_ ] _−∞, sE_ 0[, and _λ_ 1( _s_ ) _∈_ ] _sE_ 0 _, sE_ 1[, respectively, we only obtain the trivial bound of _g_ ( _s_ ) _≥_ 0. Obtaining tight bounds required a
more fine-grained analysis, which we undertake in the subsequent sections.
Note that the _N −_ _M_ eigenstates in _HS_ _[⊥]_ [are not relevant for the adiabatic evolution.]
This is because the system is initialized in the ground state of _H_ 0, _|ψ_ 0 _⟩∈HS_, and consequently, throughout the adiabatic evolution, the dynamics is restricted to the symmetric
subspace _HS_ . Thus, for brevity, we shall henceforth refer to _H_ [¯] ( _s_ ), the restriction of the
total adiabatic Hamiltonian to the symmetric subspace _HS_, as simply _H_ ( _s_ ). So with this
relabelling, we have



_H_ ( _s_ ) = _−_ (1 _−_ _s_ ) _|ψ_ 0 _⟩⟨ψ_ 0 _|_ + _s_

Thus effectively, the problem Hamiltonian _Hz_, restricted to this subspace has _M_ distinct
eigenvalues, 0 _≤_ _E_ 0 _< E_ 1 _< · · · EM_ _−_ 1 _<_ 1. We shall refer to the gap between the two
lowest non-degenerate eigenvalues as the spectral gap of _Hz_ . That is, ∆= _E_ 1 _−_ _E_ 0.
Furthermore, the spectral parameters _Ap_ for _p ∈_ N are defined as

where recall that _dk_ is the degeneracy of eigenvalue _Ek_ . In the next section, we identify the
position of the avoided crossing in the spectrum of _H_ ( _s_ ) and obtain useful bounds on the
spectral gap as a function of _s_, which will help us in (i) constructing the optimal adiabatic
schedule and (ii) quantifying the running time of the resulting adiabatic algorithm.


2.2 Finding the Position of Avoided Crossing


We will divide the interval [0 _,_ 1], which is the range of the schedule function _s_, into three
regions. For this define

_A_ 1
_s_ _[∗]_ = (26)
_A_ 1 + 1 _[,]_



and

2
_δs_ =
( _A_ 1 + 1) [2]


Then [0 _,_ 1] = _Is_ _[←]_ [�] _Is_ _[∗]_ [�] _Is_ _[→]_, where

_Is_ _[←]_ = [0 _, s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _δs_ ) _, Is_ _[∗]_ = [ _s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _δs, s_ _[∗]_ + _δs_ ] _,_ and _Is_ _[→]_ = ( _s_ _[∗]_ + _δs,_ 1] (28)


We will first show that the spectral gap _g_ ( _s_ ) is minimum in the interval _Is_ _[∗]_ . Consequently,
we will look for the two smallest solutions of Eq. (22), of the form _λ_ ( _s_ ) = _sE_ 0 + _δ±_ ( _s_ ).
Substituting this in Eq. (22), we obtain

_s_ ( _Ek −_ _E_ 0) _−_ _δ±_ 1 _−_ _s_



We prove that within a symmetric interval around _s_ _[∗]_, the two smallest solutions to Eq. (29)
( _δ_ + and _δ−_ respectively) can be obtained. Note that this also allows us to bound the
spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ) in this window, as _g_ ( _s_ ) = _δ_ +( _s_ ) _−_ _δ−_ ( _s_ ). More precisely, consider the
interval
_Is_ _[∗]_ = [ _s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _δs, s_ _[∗]_ + _δs_ ] _._ (30)


Then, we prove via Lemma A1, borrowing techniques from Ref. [51], that for any _s ∈Is_ _[∗]_,
the two smallest solutions of Eq. (29) are given by


            -             _δ_ +( _s_ ) _∈_ (1 _−_ _η_ ) _δ_ 0 [+][(] _[s]_ [)] _[,]_ [ (1 +] _[ η]_ [)] _[δ]_ 0 [+][(] _[s]_ [)] _,_ and (31)

where, _η_ is a small constant ( _≪_ 1), and

This immediately implies for _s ∈Is_ _[∗]_, the spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ), which is _g_ ( _s_ ) = _δ_ +( _s_ ) _−_
_δ−_ ( _s_ ), is simply _δ_ 0 [+][(] _[s]_ [)] _[ −]_ _[δ]_ 0 _[−]_ [(] _[s]_ [)][, up to a relative error of][ 2] _[η]_ [. Thus,]

Interestingly, for any _s ∈Is_ _[∗]_, we can obtain an upper bound on _g_ ( _s_ ). We formally prove
this via the following Lemma:


**Lemma 9.** _Consider the positive constant c from Definition 4, and the adiabatic Hamil-_
_tonian H_ ( _s_ ) _in Eq._ (24) _. Furthermore, define_

_g_ min _≤_ _g_ ( _s_ ) _≤_ _κ_ _[′]_ _· g_ min _._ (35)


_Proof._ We have already shown that _g_ min is the minimum gap of _H_ ( _s_ ), for any _s ∈Is_ _[∗]_ .

Similarly, it is easy to see that _δs/s_ _[∗]_ _≤_ 2 _c_ . Substituting these back into Eq. (39), we have

Thus, in the entire interval _Is_ _[∗]_, the gap _g_ ( _s_ ) = Θ( _g_ min) . We claim that the avoided
crossing lies within this interval centered around _s_ _[∗]_ . To this end, we show that for any
_s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1] _\Is_ _[∗]_, the scaling of the spectral gap is at least as large as the scaling of the gap
in _Is_ _[∗]_ .


**Bounding the spectral gap to the left of the avoided crossing:** Define the interval _Is_ _[←]_ =

[0 _, s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _δs_ ), which is to the left of the region of the avoided crossing. We obtain a tight
lower bound on the spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ) in this region, which is at least as large as the
gap for any _s ∈Is_ _[∗]_ . We come up with a non-trivial ansatz state _|ϕ⟩_ that allows us to
leverage the variational principle and first obtain an upper bound on the ground energy
as _λ_ 0( _s_ ) _≤⟨ϕ|H_ ( _s_ ) _|ϕ⟩_ . Then the lower bound on the gap _g_ ( _s_ ) is obtained by using this
bound, along with the fact that from Eq. (22), the energy of the first excited state satisfies
_λ_ 1( _s_ ) _≥_ _sE_ 0, in this region. Formally, we state the following lemma:


**Lemma 10.** _Consider the adiabatic Hamiltonian H_ ( _s_ ) _defined in Eq._ (24) _. Then, for any_
_s ∈Is_ _[←]_ _, the spectral gap of H_ ( _s_ ) _satisfies_

_Proof._ Suppose _λ_ 0( _s_ ) _, λ_ 1( _s_ ) is the ground state energy and the first excited state energy of
_H_ ( _s_ ), respectively. Then, in order to obtain a lower bound on the gap _g_ ( _s_ ) = _λ_ 1( _s_ ) _−λ_ 0( _s_ ),
for any _s ∈Is_ _[←]_, we make use of the variational principle. We can obtain an upper bound
on _λ_ 0( _s_ ) by noting that from the variational principle, for any ansatz _|ϕ⟩_ of unit norm,
_λ_ 0( _s_ ) _≤⟨ϕ|H_ ( _s_ ) _|ϕ⟩_ . Consider the ansatz

We shall use this upper bound on _λ_ 0( _s_ ) to estimate the gap to the left of the avoided

which implies that the spectral gap is larger than the scaling of the gap in _Is_ _[∗]_ .


**Bounding the spectral gap to the right of the avoided crossing:** Obtaining a tight bound
on the spectral gap to the right of the avoided crossing is considerably more challenging.
This is because the spectrum is more complicated in this region (See Fig. 1), and we
require a different technique to keep track of the gap. We consider a straight line _γ_ ( _s_ )
from _sE_ 0 + _k g_ min (at _s_ = _s_ _[∗]_ ) to some point _a_ between the two lowest eigenvalues of _Hz_
at _s_ = 1, where _k <_ 1 is a non-trivial constant and _a_ controls the slope of this line. The
gap _g_ ( _s_ ) is then lower bounded by twice the inverse of the norm of the resolvent of _H_ ( _s_ )
with respect to _γ_ ( _s_ ), denoted by _RH_ ( _s_ )( _γ_ ). We obtain an upper bound on the norm of
resolvent (equivalently, a lower bound on the gap) by the Sherman-Morrison formula [41].
Additionally, by carefully tuning _k_ and _a_, we obtain a good enough lower bound on _g_ ( _s_ )
for any _s ≥_ _s_ _[∗]_ (including the interval _Is_ _[→]_ = ( _s_ _[∗]_ + _δs,_ 1]). We can also prove that _g_ min is a
lower bound on the spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ) in this interval. Formally, we state the following
lemma:



**Lemma 11.** _Let k_ = 1 _/_ 4 _, g_ min _be the minimum spectral gap of H_ ( _s_ ) _as defined in Eq._ (34) _,_
_and_ ∆ _be the spectral gap of the problem Hamiltonian Hz._ _Furthermore, define a_ =
4 _k_ [2] ∆ _/_ 3 _, and_



_s_ 0 = _s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _[k g]_ [min][ (1] _[ −]_ _[s][∗]_ [)]



_._
_a −_ _k g_ min



_Then for all s ≥_ _s_ _[∗]_ _, the spectral gap of H_ ( _s_ ) _is lower bounded as_


_s −_ _s_ 0

_g_ ( _s_ ) _≥_ [∆] _._ (44)

30 1 _−_ _s_ 0


_Proof._ We choose _γ_ ( _s_ ) to be a line that lies between the lowest and second lowest eigenvalues of _H_ ( _s_ ). More precisely, _γ_ ( _s_ ) = _sE_ 0 + _β_ ( _s_ ), where

We shall choose the appropriate values of _a_ and _k_ later. The spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ) is at
least twice the minimum distance of _γ_ ( _s_ ) from the spectrum of _H_ ( _s_ ). That is,


2
_g_ ( _s_ ) _≥_ _,_ (45)
~~��~~                                     - _RH_ ( _s_ )( _γ_ ) ~~��~~                                     

where _RH_ ( _s_ ) is the resolvent (See Eq. (1) for the definition). Thus, we simply need to obtain

an upper bound on ��� _RH_ ( _s_ )( _γ_ )���. To this end, applying the Sherman-Morrison formula (See
Eq. (2)), followed by the triangle inequality, we obtain


��� _RH_ ( _s_ )( _γ_ )��� _≤∥RsHz_ ( _γ_ ) _∥_ + (1 _−_ _s_ ) _∥RsHz_ ( _γ_ ) _|ψ_ 0 _⟩⟨ψ_ 0 _|RsHz_ ( _γ_ ) _∥_ (46)

First observe that _∥RsHz_ ( _γ_ ) _∥_ = _β_ _[−]_ [1] . Now, for the second term of Eq. (46), we calculate
bounds on the numerator and denominator separately. For the denominator, we first
expand according to the definition of the resolvent in Eq. (1), and then consider its Taylor
Series expansion in _β_ to get

gives us the following lower bound on the denominator

Note that from Lemma 11 we have that _f_ ( _s_ ) is maximum at _s_ = _s_ _[∗]_, and moreover,
_f_ ( _s_ _[∗]_ ) = Θ(1). Thus, _g_ ( _s_ _[∗]_ ) _≥_ _O_ ( _β_ ( _s_ _[∗]_ )) = _O_ ( _g_ min). From this, we conclude that the lower
bound on the spectral gap given in Lemma 11 satisfies, _g_ ( _s_ ) _≥_ _O_ ( _g_ min) for all _s ∈_ [ _s_ _[∗]_ _,_ 1].
This completes the picture vis-a-vis the spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ): the gap is minimum in
the vicinity of the avoided crossing ( _s ∈Is_ _[∗]_ ) and is at least as large outside this interval
( _s ∈Is_ _[←]_ and _s ∈Is_ _[→]_, respectively). The comparison between the true gap _g_ ( _s_ ) and
our estimated lower bound for each of the three intervals is illustrated in Fig. 3 for a
20-qubit Hamiltonian where _Hz_ is diagonal in the computational basis with uniformly
spaced eigenenergy levels between 0 and 1. Each such eigenlevel is _dk_ degenerate, such
that the degeneracies are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution. The knowledge
of the lower bound on the spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ) in all the regions of its domain allows us
to construct the optimal local adiabatic schedule and subsequently estimate the running
time of the overall adiabatic algorithm. We will discuss this in the next section.


2.3 Optimal adiabatic schedule and running time


In order to obtain the running time of AQO, we first develop a simplified version of the
adiabatic theorem, extending the recent results of Ref. [44] on phase randomization to
the continuous-time (adiabatic) setting. Our results are quite generic: they hold for any
parametrized Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ) that is twice differentiable, with a known lower bound on
its spectral gap _g_ ( _s_ ). We rigorously derive the time _T_ after which evolving an initial state
under _H_ ( _s_ ) with a local schedule has a fidelity of at least 1 _−_ _ε_ with the ground state
of the problem Hamiltonian. In particular, we consider a schedule relevant to our case,
namely a local schedule whose derivative scales with the inverse of the instantaneous gap.
The detailed proofs of our generic results on the adiabatic theorem have been derived in
the Appendix (Sec. C). In this section, we discuss the running time of AQO, which uses
this version of the adiabatic theorem.
In order to obtain the running time, all we need are the bounds obtained on the gap
_g_ ( _s_ ) in Sec. 2.2. For the adiabatic evolution, we make use of a local adaptive schedule that
takes into account the instantaneous gap _g_ ( _s_ ). This ensures that the system evolves rapidly
in regions where the gap _g_ ( _s_ ) is large and slows down sufficiently when _g_ ( _s_ ) is small (in
and around the vicinity of the avoided crossing). In particular, we make use of a schedule


Accepted in 2025-07-03, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 23


whose derivative scales with the gap _g_ ( _s_ ), as has also been used in prior works [26, 29].
We state our result on the running time of AQO via the following Theorem (restated from
Sec. 1.2) while the detailed derivation can be found in the Appendix (Sec. D):


**Theorem 5** (Main result 1: Running time of AQO) **.** _Let ε ∈_ [0 _,_ 1) _and consider the_
_adiabatic Hamiltonian_
_H_ ( _s_ ) = _−_ (1 _−_ _s_ ) _|ψ_ 0 _⟩⟨ψ_ 0 _|_ + _sHz,_

_such that |ψ_ 0 _⟩_ = _|_ + _⟩_ _[⊗][n]_ _and Hz satisfies the conditions of Definition 4. Then, adiabatic_
_quantum optimization prepares a quantum state that has a fidelity of at least_ 1 _−_ _ε with an_
_equal superposition of the ground states of Hz, given by_

_._



_Proof:_ The proof is obtained by applying Theorem A7 to AQO and is stated in detail
in the Appendix (Sec. D).


Now, when _Hz_ corresponds to the (normalized) classical Ising Hamiltonian (defined in
Eq. (6)), we have ∆ _≥_ 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ) and _A_ 2 _≤_ 1 _/_ ∆ [2] _≤_ poly( _n_ ). This implies that the
ground state of the problem Hamiltonian is prepared with a constant fidelity in a time
_T_ = _O_ [�] (�2 ~~_[n]_~~ _/d_ 0). This matches the lower bound of Ref. [28] (up to log factors) when the

degeneracy _d_ 0 does not scale with 2 _[n]_ .
Although these results prove a generic quadratic advantage over brute force search for
AQO, there are caveats. The main disadvantage is the necessity of constructing a local
schedule whose derivative scales with the instantaneous gap _g_ ( _s_ ). We argue that for such
a schedule, it is necessary to apriori predict the position of the avoided crossing _s_ _[∗]_ with
sufficient accuracy. Recall that the bounds on _g_ ( _s_ ) for each of the three intervals are as
follows:



(57)



_A_ 1( _A_ 1 + 1) - 
( _s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _s_ ) _,_ _s ∈Is_ _[←]_ = 0 _, s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _δs_

1 _g_ min    -    
[∆] _·_ _,_ _s ∈Is_ _[→]_ = _s_ _[∗]_ _,_ 1

30 _[·]_ 1 _−_ _s_ 0 ∆ _/_ 3 _−_ _g_ min



Observe that in the vicinity of the avoided crossing (a window of size _δs_ to either side
of _s_ _[∗]_ ), the rate of change in the schedule is constant. However, for this region, prior
knowledge of _g_ min is an imperative necessity. The factor that dominates the algorithmic
running time is, in fact, 2 _[−][n/]_ [2] . Replacing the parameter _A_ 2 with its (known) lower bound
(which is a constant) suffices, while a guess of _d_ 0 = 1 ensures that _g_ min is lower bounded
by 2 _[−][n/]_ [2], quantity that is only smaller than _g_ min by a factor of poly( _n_ ).
On the other hand, away from the position of the avoided crossing, (in the intervals _Is_ _[←]_
and _Is_ _[→]_ ), the rate of change of the schedule is regulated by the distance from the avoided
crossing ( _s −_ _s_ _[∗]_ or _s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _s_ ). Indeed, a linear dependence of the gap on this distance ensures


Accepted in 2025-07-03, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 24


that the adiabatic evolution is fast when the gap is large and slows down as it approaches
the avoided crossing. Estimating _s_ _[∗]_ up to an additive accuracy of _O_ ( _δs_ ) suffices, as the
gap scales as _O_ ( _g_ min) in the whole of _Is_ _[∗]_ .
Thus, _s_ _[∗]_ needs to be pre-computed up to this accuracy to obtain the correct local
schedule before running the adiabatic algorithm. This, in turn, is contingent on computing
_A_ 1 to an additive accuracy of _O_ ( _δs_ ). In these regions as well, note the presence of spectral
parameters _A_ 1, _A_ 2 as (multiplicative or additive) factors to _s_ _−_ _s_ _[∗]_ (or _s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _s_ ) in the bounds
we obtain on _g_ ( _s_ ). However, as before, these quantities can be replaced by their known
lower/upper bounds, leading to only a _O_ (poly(∆)) slowdown. For the Ising Hamiltonian,
this is just _O_ (poly( _n_ )).
To summarize, in order to obtain the running time in Theorem 5 by running AQO, it
is crucial to first estimate _A_ 1 to accuracy _O_ ( _δs_ ) in a time at most _T_ . This ensures: (i) the
avoided crossing is correctly predicted to be within the interval _Is_ _[∗]_ = [ _s_ _[∗]_ _−_ _δs, s_ _[∗]_ + _δs_ ], and
(ii) this pre-computation requires a time that is less than the overall running time _T_ of the
adiabatic algorithm. Consequently, we ask the following question: Given the description
of the Hamiltonian _Hz_ (in some form), how hard is it to compute the parameter _A_ 1 to the
desired additive precision?
Since we are interested in the potential for generic speedups in a purely adiabatic
setting, we assume that the adiabatic quantum optimizer does not have access to a digital,
gate-based quantum computer. However, it is, in principle, possible to estimate _A_ 1 to
the desired precision using a classical device. In the next section, we prove that this is
computationally hard.

### 3 Hardness of predicting the position of the Avoided Crossing


In the previous sections, we have demonstrated that adiabatic quantum optimization can
find the ground states of any Hamiltonian (having a sufficiently large spectral gap and
diagonal in the computational basis) with a quadratic speedup over unstructured “brute
force” classical search. However, prior knowledge of the position of the avoided crossing
was necessary for the algorithm to be optimal. Predicting the position of the avoided
crossing to any accuracy reduces to the problem of estimating the spectral parameter _A_ 1
to the same precision. In this section, we prove that estimating this quantity is computationally hard. Particularly for this section, we change the notation slightly for brevity.
Consider any _n_ -qubit Hamiltonian _H_ diagonal in the computational basis having distinct
eigenlevels with eigenenergies _E_ 0 _< E_ 1 _< · · · EM_ _−_ 1, such that each eigenlevel with eigenvalue _Ek_ is _dk_ -fold degenerate. Then, we relabel the spectral parameter _A_ 1 (defined in
Eq. (3)) as _A_ 1( _H_ ) for convenience. That is,



_A_ 1( _H_ ) = [1]

2 _[n]_



_M_ _−_ 1



_k_ =1



_dk_
_._ (58)
_Ek −_ _E_ 0



We first show that the problem of estimating _A_ 1 to within an additive accuracy of 1 _/_ poly( _n_ )
is NP-hard, and subsequently prove that estimating it exactly (or to _O_ (2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] ) additive
accuracy) is #P-hard.


3.1 NP-hardness of estimating **A1** to a low precision


Here, we show that estimating the spectral parameter _A_ 1 to an additive precision of at
most 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ) is NP-hard. Note that this is significantly larger than the precision with
which _A_ 1 needs to be approximated for AQO (which is roughly 2 _[−][n/]_ [2] ). This implies


Accepted in 2025-07-03, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 25


that the problem of predicting the position of the avoided crossing, even to within a
precision substantially larger than what is needed for AQO, is already computationally
hard. More precisely, suppose there exists a classical procedure that accepts the description
of a classical Hamiltonian _H_ (diagonal in the computational basis) and outputs _A_ 1 to a
precision of _O_ (1 _/_ poly( _n_ )). Then, we prove that by making only two calls to this procedure,
it is possible to solve 3-SAT. In such settings, the problem reduces to distinguishing
between two promised thresholds of a Hamiltonian _H_, corresponding to the underlying
computationally hard problem.
Suppose we are given a normalized classical Hamiltonian _H_ with the promise that its
ground energy satisfies either (i) _E_ 0 = 0 or (ii) _µ_ 1 _≤_ _E_ 0 _≤_ 1 _−_ _µ_ 2, for some _µ_ 1 _, µ_ 2, and the
goal would be two disambiguate between (i) and (ii). Note that this is closely related to the
_local Hamiltonian problem_, where it is required to determine whether the ground energy is
above or below a certain threshold and is known to be NP-hard for classical Hamiltonians
as long as the gap (between the two thresholds) is at least 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ) [5]. This particular
variant of the local Hamiltonian problem is still NP-Hard: the 3-SATproblem can be
solved by distinguishing the two thresholds of the ground energy of a Hamiltonian _H_ that
corresponds to this problem.
Now suppose there is a classical procedure _Cε_ that accepts the description of a Hamiltonian _H_ and outputs an estimate of _A_ 1 to additive accuracy of 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ). Then we
show that if _µ_ 1 _, µ_ 2 scale as 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ), then by making only two calls to _Cε_, it is possible
to disambiguate between (i) and (ii), provided _ε ≤_ 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ). In fact, we prove a more
general lemma that provides an upper bound on the accuracy _ε_ as a function of _µ_ 1 and
_µ_ 2, such that the disambiguation is possible by making only two calls to _Cε_ . As mentioned
earlier, 3-SAT can be posed in terms of this disambiguation problem. Thus, this implies
that 3-SAT can be solved by making only two calls to any procedure estimating _A_ 1 to
an additive accuracy of most 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ), which allows us to subsequently conclude that
estimating _A_ 1 to this precision is NP-hard. We begin by proving the following general
lemma:


**Lemma 12.** _Let ε, µ_ 1 _, µ_ 2 _∈_ (0 _,_ 1) _. Suppose there exists a classical procedure Cε_ ( _⟨H⟩_ ) _that_
_accepts the description of a Hamiltonian H and outputs_ _A_ [�] 1( _H_ ) _such that_

_A_ 1( _H_ ) _−_ _A_ 1( _H_ ) _≤_ _ε._
���� ���


_Now consider any n-qubit Hamiltonian H, diagonal in the computational basis such that_
_it has eigenvalues_ 0 _≤_ _E_ 0 _< E_ 1 _< . . . < EM_ _−_ 1 _≤_ 1 _such that M ∈_ poly( _n_ ) _, and eigenvalue_
_Ek has degeneracy dk. Furthermore, suppose that the ground energy E_ 0 _of H satisfies the_
_following: Either (i) E_ 0 = 0 _or (ii)_ 0 _≤_ _µ_ 1 _≤_ _E_ 0 _≤_ 1 _−_ _µ_ 2 _≤_ 1 _. Then, it is possible to_
_decide whether (i) or (ii) holds, by making two calls to Cε, provided_

_for a_ 3 _-local Hamiltonian on n qubits that satisfies the conditions in Definition 4 is_ NP _-_

_Proof._ We consider the 2-local version of 3-SAT, inspired by the reduction of 3-SAT to
MAX-2-SAT (a variant of the 2-SATproblem which asks the maximum number satisfying
clauses of a given Boolean formula) in Ref. [54]. Suppose _xi ∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_ is a binary Boolean
variable, and ¯ _xi_ be its negation. Consider that we are given some _m_ clauses of the form
_ak ∨_ _bk ∨_ _ck_, where each _ak, bk, ck_ is either _xl_ or ~~_x_~~ _l_ with 0 _≤_ _l ≤_ _n −_ 1. A satisfying
assignment makes

true. If _n_ + _m <_ 15, use brute-force search. Now assume _n_ + _m ≥_ 15. Set


_z_ _z_
_Pxl_ := _[I][ −]_ _[σ]_ [(] _[l]_ [)] _,_ and _P_ ~~_x_~~ _l_ := _[I]_ [ +] _[ σ]_ [(] _[l]_ [)] _._
2 2


For each 0 _≤_ _k < m_, define the following Hamiltonian:


_Hk_ := _P_ ~~_a_~~ _k_ + _Pbk_ + _P_ ~~_c_~~ _k_ + _P_ ~~_x_~~ _n_ + _k_

+ _P_ ~~_a_~~ _k_ _Pxn_ + _k_ + ~~_P_~~ _bk_ _Pxn_ + _k_ + _P_ ~~_c_~~ _k_ _Pxn_ + _k_ _._


If the _k_ [th] clause is satisfied, then the lowest eigenvalue of _Hk_ is 3. Otherwise, it is 4.
The largest possible eigenvalue of _Hk_ is 6. Now consider the Hamiltonian, which acts on
2 _m_ + 2 _n_ qubits,

From these reductions, we conclude that estimating the position of the avoided crossing
to even a (very low) precision of 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ) is NP-hard. In our proof of Lemma 12 and
subsequently Theorem 13, the modified Hamiltonian _H_ _[′]_ is 3-local. In the next section, our
proof of #P-hardness of (nearly) exactly estimating the position of the avoided crossing
works for even 2-local, Ising Hamiltonians.


3.2 #P-hardness of estimating **A1** (nearly) exactly


In this section, we prove that the problem of estimating _A_ 1 exactly or to a precision of
_O_ (2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] ) is #P-hard. We first prove the claim that it is #P-hard to estimate _A_ 1 exactly.
For this, consider the Ising Hamiltonian



_Hσ_ = - _Jijσz_ _[i]_ _[σ]_ _z_ _[j]_ [+]

_⟨i,j⟩_



_n_

- _hjσz_ _[j][,]_ (74)

_j_ =1



defined as in Eq. (6) (parameters _Jij_ and _hi_ are in some constant range of integers, and the
distinct eigenvalues _Ei_ are integers). We show that by making only a polynomial number of
calls to an algorithm that exactly computes _A_ 1( _Hσ_ ), one can efficiently compute outcome
probabilities of IQP circuits, or the degeneracy of the ground state energy of _Hσ_ . Note
that both these problems are known to be #P-hard.
In particular, we note that the problem determining the degeneracy of the ground
state can be related to that of counting the number of solutions of NP-complete problems.
For instance, consider the problem of counting the number of satisfying assignments in
a 3-SAT formula. While 3-SAT is NP-complete problem, its counting analogue, #3-SAT,
which counts the number of satisfying assignments in the underlying Boolean formula, is
#P-complete. It is well known that the solution to a 3-SAT problem can be encoded in
the ground states of _Hσ_ [24, 55]. Then, extracting the degeneracy of the ground states of
such a Hamiltonian is equivalent to solving #3-SAT.
First, let us note that for the Ising Hamiltonian _Hσ_, if _hj, Jjk_ belong to any set of integers of constant size, there can be almost _M_ = _O_ ( _n_ [2] ) different values for the eigenenergies
of _Hσ_ . Then, our argument boils down to extracting the degeneracies of _dk_ by making
_O_ (poly( _n_ )) calls to any algorithm that estimates _A_ 1( _Hσ_ ). As argued previously, estimating
_d_ 0 would imply solving #3-SAT, which is #P-complete. Alternatively, the exact knowledge of the values of _dk_ associated with each gap ∆ _k_ allows us to compute exactly the
output probability of an IQP circuit, which is known to be #P-hard. That is, from the
knowledge of the degeneracies _{dk}_, we can evaluate

In what follows, we show how to extract the values of _dk_ from a function that computes
_A_ 1( _H_ ) exactly for any Ising Hamiltonian, _Hσ_ . Formally, we prove the following lemma:


**Lemma 14.** _Suppose there exists a classical algorithm C_ ( _⟨H⟩_ ) _which accepts as input the_
_description of an n-qubit Hamiltonian H and outputs A_ 1( _H_ ) _. Furthermore, suppose Hσ be_

which can be estimated with a single call to _C_, using a description of _H_ _[′]_ as an input (for

In what follows, we show that by computing _f_ ( _x_ ) for _O_ (poly( _n_ )) different values of _x_, it is
possible to extract the values of the degeneracies _dk_ . To this end, define the polynomial
of degree _M −_ 1 given by:

Since the values of the gaps ∆ _k_ are known (we assume them to be integers), we can evaluate
_f_ ( _x_ ) at _M_ values of distinct _xi >_ 0 to guarantee that _f_ ( _x_ ) is finite) and obtain _M_ values
_P_ ( _xi_ ). For instance, we choose odd integer points _xi_ = _i_, where _i ∈{_ 1 _,_ 3 _, ...,_ 2 _M −_ 1 _}_,
which are sufficient to fully determine _P_ ( _x_ ). This requires making only 2 _M_ = _O_ (poly( _n_ ))
calls to _C_ .
Using, for example, Lagrange interpolation (which for a polynomial of degree _M −_ 1
requires _O_ (poly( _n_ )) time) [56], we can fully reconstruct the polynomial _P_ ( _x_ ), which can
now be evaluated at any point. The degeneracies can be extracted since


2 _[n]_ _P_ ( _−_ 2∆ _k_ )

_ℓ̸_ = _k_ [(∆] _[ℓ]_ _[−]_ [∆] _[k]_ [)] _[, k][ ∈{]_ [0] _[, ..., M][ −]_ [1] _[}][.]_


As argued previously, extracting the degeneracies can be used to solve any problem in
the #P complexity class. Thus, by using _C_ as a subroutine, it would also be possible to
extract the degeneracies in the spectrum of an NP-Complete Hamiltonian (such as 3-SAT)
in polynomial time, thereby efficiently solving a #P-Hard problem. It is possible to show
that this hardness proof is robust to exponentially small additive errors in the computation
of _A_ 1( _H_ ), which can be shown using Paturi’s lemma (Corollary 1 of Ref. [57]), which we
state below:

**Lemma 15** (Corollary 1 of [57]) **.** _Let P_ ( _x_ ) _be a polynomial of degree,_ deg( _P_ ) _≤_ _M_ _, and_
_|P_ ( _i_ ) _| ≤_ _c for integers i ∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _, · · ·, M_ _}. Then,_


_∀x ∈_ [0 _, M_ ] _, |P_ ( _x_ ) _| ≤_ _c ·_ 2 [deg(] _[P]_ [)] _._


It is easy to see why this lemma is useful for us. By querying the supposed classical
algorithm that approximates _A_ 1( _Hσ_ ), _O_ (poly( _n_ )) times, we can construct a polynomial
sampled at integral points in the domain. Then, it is possible to upper bound its error with
the polynomial constructed in Eq. (79) for the entire domain [0 _, M_ ] by Paturi’s lemma.
We prove that when this error is sufficiently small ( _O_ (2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] )), the degeneracies _dk_ can
still be extracted. We elaborate on this proof next.
First assume we have access to a classical algorithm _Cε_ which accepts as input the description of some _n_ -qubit Hamiltonian, and outputs _A_ [�] 1( _H_ ) such that

_A_ 1( _H_ ) _−_ _A_ 1( _H_ ) _≤_ _ε._ (81)
���� ���


Then, as before, by making two calls to _Cε_, we can obtain an approximation _f_ [�] ( _x_ ) such that
_|f_ ( _x_ ) _−f_ ( _x_ ) _| ≤_ 3 _ε_, where _f_ ( _x_ ) is as defined in Eq. (78). Subsequently, it is possible to define

[�]
the _M −_ 1 degree polynomial _P_ [�] ( _x_ ) polynomial defined by the _M_ points ( _xi_ = _i,_ _P_ [�] ( _xi_ )),
where _i ∈{_ 1 _,_ 3 _, ...,_ 2 _M −_ 1 _}_ are odd integers such that



_P_ �( _xi_ ) =



_M_ _−_ 1

which can be constructed by making 2 _M_ = _O_ (poly( _n_ )) calls to _Cε_ . Therefore, it follows
that

and hence, from Lemma 15, at any point _x ∈_ [1 _,_ 2 _M −_ 1] we have that

It can be seen, using Eq. (80) that for sufficiently small error _ε_ = _O_ (2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] ) it is
possible to ensure that the additive error in the approximation of the degeneracies _dk_
is less than 1 _/_ 2, and so their exact values can simply be obtained by rounding up the
approximate value to the nearest integer. The derivation above shows that it is #P-hard
to approximate _A_ 1( _H_ ) up to additive error _ε_ = _O_ (2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] ). We summarize this formally
via the following lemma:


**Lemma 16.** _Suppose there exists a classical algorithm Cε_ ( _⟨H⟩_ ) _which accepts as input the_
_description of an n-qubit Hamiltonian H, and outputs_ _A_ [�] 1( _H_ ) _such that_

_A_ 1( _H_ ) _−_ _A_ 1( _H_ ) _≤_ _ε._
���� ���


_Furthermore, suppose Hσ be the n-qubit Ising Hamiltonian (with appropriate parameter_
_ranges, as defined in Eq._ (6) _), such that its eigenenergies are E_ 0 _< E_ 1 _< · · · Ek, where_
0 _≤_ _k ≤_ _M −_ 1 _, with known spectral gaps_ ∆ _k_ = _Ek −_ _E_ 0 _. Then for all k ∈_ [0 _, M −_ 1] _,_
_for some sufficiently small ε ∈_ _O_ (2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] ) _, it is possible to estimate the degeneracy dk of_
_energy eigenvalue Ek by making O_ (poly( _n_ )) _calls to Cε._

Lemma 14 and Lemma 16 combined, prove Theorem 7.


Our proof can be extended to the probabilistic case, namely where the classical algorithm
_Cε_ outputs an estimate _A_ 1 to an additive accuracy of _ε ∈_ _O_ (2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] ) with a constant
probability (say _≥_ 3 _/_ 4). Then, even in this setting, the degeneracies _dk_ of an Ising Hamiltonian _Hσ_ can be exactly estimated with a high probability. This implies the problem of
estimating _A_ 1 remains hard even when the classical algorithm is probabilistic. The central
ideas are as follows: In this case, two queries to _Cε_ are needed to obtain each correct sampling point ( _xi,_ _P_ [�] ( _xi_ )), with a constant probability. As before, we need to re-construct the
polynomial _P_ of degree _M −_ 2 for distinct samples. However, instead of making 2 _M_ queries

[�]
to _Cε_, we query the algorithm some _k_ = _O_ (poly( _n_ )) times (such that this is sufficiently
larger than _M −_ 2). In fact, by using the Chernoff bound, it is possible to determine that
with a high probability, ( _k_ + _M −_ 2) _/_ 2 correct sample points ( _xi,_ _P_ [�] ( _xi_ )) can be obtained
by making _k_ = _O_ (poly( _n_ )) queries to the classical algorithm. Then, the Berlekamp-Welch
algorithm, which we state below, allows us to reconstruct the polynomial _P_ exactly:

[�]


**Theorem 17** (Berlekamp-Welch algorithm [35]) **.** _Let P be a polynomial of degree d over_
_any field_ F _. Suppose we are given k pairs of elements {_ ( _xi, yi_ ) _}i_ =1 _,...,k such that yi_ = _P_ ( _xi_ )
_for at least_ max _{d_ + 1 _,_ ( _k_ + _d_ ) _/_ 2 _} points. Then, the polynomial P can be recovered in time_
_O_ (poly( _k, d_ )) _._


It is worth mentioning that the Berlekamp-Welch algorithm has been instrumental in
proving hardness results in quantum supremacy proposals [35, 34]. In our context, this
algorithm allows us to reconstruct the polynomial _P_ exactly (we have _d_ = _M −_ 2). Sub
[�]
sequently, using the arguments of Lemma 16 it is possible to prove that the degeneracies
_dk_ can be estimated exactly with a high probability, provided the additive accuracy with
which _Cε_ estimates _A_ 1 is some _ε ∈_ _O_ (2 _[−]_ [poly][(] _[n]_ [)] ).
Unfortunately, these proof techniques based on polynomial interpolation do not allow
us to conclude anything about the hardness of the approximation of _A_ 1( _H_ ) up to the
additive error tolerated by the adiabatic algorithm described in Sec. 2. We remark that
limitations of hardness proofs based on polynomial interpolation were also identified in
the context of proposals for demonstration of quantum computational advantage such as
Boson sampling [32] and random circuit sampling [34], leading to conjectures about the
hardness of approximating outcome probabilities from these circuits which still remain
open. From the statement of Theorem 5, we require an algorithm that estimates _A_ 1 to
additive accuracy _O_ ( _δs_ ) in time at most _O_ [�] ( ~~�~~ 2 ~~_[n]_~~ _/d_ 0). However, the best classical algo
rithms for approximating the solutions to #P-complete problems leverage sampling-based
techniques and have a running time of _O_ (1 _/δs_ [2][) =][ �] _[O]_ [(2] _[n][/d]_ [0][)][ [][58][]. One might consider us-]
ing sampling-based methods to estimate _A_ 1 to the desired precision. For instance, given a
Hamiltonian _H_, suppose there exists a procedure that efficiently samples the inverse gaps
∆ _k_ according to the probability distribution _{dk/_ 2 _[n]_ _}k_ =1 _,...,M_ _−_ 1. Then, how many queries
to this procedure are required to estimate the expectation value of this distribution (which
is _µ_ = _A_ 1) to a precision of _δs_ ? Note that the variance is _σ_ [2] = _A_ 2 _−_ _A_ [2] 1 _[≤]_ _[A]_ [2][. By us-]
ing Chebyshev’s inequality, it is easy to see that at least _O_ [�] (2 _[n]_ _/d_ 0) queries are needed to
estimate _A_ 1 to a precision of _δs_, with a constant probability. While arguing along these
lines provides evidence that it is hard to estimate _A_ 1 to the desired precision, we could
concretely demonstrate that this is NP-hard from Sec. 3.1, albeit for a 3-local Hamiltonian.
Overall, these results prove that it is NP-hard to estimate _A_ 1 (consequently, the position of the avoided crossing) approximately, and #P-hard to compute it exactly or nearly

exactly. Since the optimality of AQO is contingent on predicting the position of the avoided
crossing, our results point to a possible limitation of this approach, which is absent in the
circuit model. We leave open the question of whether this can be circumvented without
requiring access to a digital quantum computer.

### 4 Discussion


We explore the possibility of obtaining quadratic speedups over brute-force classical search
in adiabatic quantum optimization for solving NP-complete problems. We provide an
adiabatic algorithm that can find the minimum of a cost function encoded in a classical Hamiltonian (diagonal in the computational basis). Our method is optimal for any
(classical) problem Hamiltonian with a large enough spectral gap. This includes Ising
Hamiltonians _Hσ_, whose ground states are known to encode solutions of NP-complete
problems. In particular, we prove that AQO requires _O_ (2 _[n/]_ [2] ) time to prepare the ground

[�]
states of _Hσ_, matching the lower bound of Ref. [28] up to polylogarithmic factors. In order
to derive our results, we obtain tight bounds on the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic
evolution and a closed-form expression of a quantity that approximates the position of the
avoided crossing. This allowed us to construct the local adiabatic schedule leading to the
aforementioned running time.
Some of the ideas presented in this work can also be used to obtain provable runtime guarantees for non-adiabatic, continuous-time quantum algorithms for preparing
the ground states of the Ising Hamiltonian, _Hσ_ [59]. For instance, consider the timeindependent Hamiltonian
_H_ = _−|ψ_ 0 _⟩⟨ψ_ 0 _|_ + _rHσ,_


where _r_ is a parameter that can be independently chosen. It is possible to prove that
for a choice of _r_ that is within an additive precision of roughly _O_ [�] (2 _[−][n/]_ [2] ) of _A_ 1, evolving
the equal superposition state _|ψ_ 0 _⟩_, according to _H_, ensures an oscillation between _|ψ_ 0 _⟩_
and the ground state of the problem Hamiltonian. The algorithm fails for any choice of
_r_ outside this symmetric interval around _A_ 1. Indeed, for the correct choice of _r ≈_ _A_ 1,
the resulting quantum state has at least a 1 _/_ poly( _n_ ) overlap with the ground states of _Hσ_
after a time _O_ (2 _[n/]_ [2] ). The details of these findings will appear elsewhere [60]. However,

[�]
as with the adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm, it is necessary to compute the
spectral parameter _A_ 1 to the desired precision before running it. Thus, our results on
the computational hardness of estimating _A_ 1 exactly or approximately also impact other
(non-adiabatic) continuous-time quantum algorithms for solving optimization problems.
A natural question is whether this issue persists for the standard choice of Hamiltonians
in adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms, i.e. when the adiabatic Hamiltonian interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian that is a local sum of spins, given by _H_ 0 = [�] _j_ _[σ]_ _x_ _[j]_
(instead of a one-dimensional projector), and an Ising Hamiltonian _Hσ_ . That is,


_H_ ( _s_ ) = _−_ (1 _−_ _s_ )        - _σx_ _[j]_ [+] _[ sH][σ][.]_ (85)

_j_


When _Hσ_ corresponds to NP-complete problems, the spectrum of _H_ ( _s_ ) is extremely complicated, and analytical results are absent. Some numerical findings have reported that
the running time in this setting is substantially better than unstructured search [48]. On
the other hand, for some random instances of NP-complete problems, it has been observed
that the spectrum of _H_ ( _s_ ) has exponentially many avoided crossings with exponentially
small gaps [25]. This makes it significantly more challenging to handle this problem analytically and derive a provable running time. Our results demonstrate that even in a

simpler setting (such as unstructured search), where the underlying Hamiltonian is guaranteed to have only a single avoided crossing, the position of this avoided crossing can be
hard to approximate.
Our work points to fundamental open problems concerning AQO. For instance, is it
possible to use AQO to obtain generic quadratic speedups for solving optimization problems without needing the assistance of a gate-based, digital quantum computer (or having
to solve a computationally hard problem in the process)? One possible direction could be
to modify the adiabatic Hamiltonian itself: expanding the dimension of the Hamiltonian
(by adding qubits) and introducing intermediate Hamiltonians at various points in the
adiabatic path. These strategies can potentially shift the position of the avoided crossing
to a point independent of the spectrum of the problem Hamiltonian. Furthermore, our
results offer interesting insights into the hardness of predicting the position of the avoided
crossing. We demonstrate that this quantity is already NP-hard to estimate to an additive
precision that is much lower than what is required by AQO. On the other hand, we also
showed that it is #P-hard to exactly (or nearly exactly) estimate this quantity. It would
be interesting to explore the precise complexity of estimating the position of the avoided
crossing to the desired accuracy.

# **Appendix**

In the Appendix, we formally derive some of the unproven claims in the main manuscript
and also develop some other results. In Sec. A, we find closed-form expressions for the
ground and first excited energies of _H_ ( _s_ ) in the vicinity of the avoided crossing. In Lemma
11, the expression for the lower bound for the spectral gap _g_ ( _s_ ) to the right of the avoided
crossing depended on the fact that _f_ ( _s_ ) is a monotonically decreasing function, which we
prove in Sec. B. In Sec. C, we derive in detail a simplified version of the adiabatic theorem,
which requires fewer assumptions on the adiabatic Hamiltonian. Finally, this allows us to
obtain the running time of AQO and prove Theorem 5 in Sec. D.

### A Ground and first excited energies of the adiabatic Hamiltonian near the avoided crossing


In Sec. 2.2, we claimed that in the vicinity of the position of the avoided crossing, i.e. for
any _s ∈Is_ _[∗]_, the two lowest eigenvalues of _H_ ( _s_ ) are of the form _λ_ ( _s_ ) = _sE_ 0 + _δ±_ ( _s_ ), such
that _δ±_ ( _s_ ) are the two smallest solutions of Eq. (29), given by


            -             _δ_ +( _s_ ) _∈_ (1 _−_ _η_ ) _δ_ 0 [+][(] _[s]_ [)] _[,]_ [ (1 +] _[ η]_ [)] _[δ]_ 0 [+][(] _[s]_ [)] _,_ and


            -             _δ−_ ( _s_ ) _∈_ (1 + _η_ ) _δ_ 0 _[−]_ [(] _[s]_ [)] _[,]_ [ (1] _[ −]_ _[η]_ [)] _[δ]_ 0 _[−]_ [(] _[s]_ [)] _,_


where, _η_ = 0 _._ 1, and _δ_ 0 _[±]_ [(] _[s]_ [)][ is as defined in Eq.][ (][33][)][. We prove this claim via the following]
lemma.


**Lemma A1.** _Let Hz be any n-qubit Hamiltonian, diagonal in the computational basis,_
_with distinct eigenvalues −_ 1 _≤_ _E_ 0 _< E_ 1 _< E_ 2 _< · · · < EM_ _−_ 1 _≤_ 1 _, such that Ek has_
_degeneracy dk, satisfying_ [�] _k_ _[M]_ =0 _[−]_ [1] _[d][k]_ [ = 2] _[n]_ [ =] _[ N]_ _[. Also suppose for a small positive constant]_
_c <_ 0 _._ 022 _, the spectral gap_ ∆ _of Hz satisfies_

_Furthermore, suppose A_ 1 _, A_ 2 _, A_ 3 _are as defined in Eq._ (3) _for p_ = 1 _,_ 2 _,_ 3 _respectively. Then,_
_for any s ∈Is_ _[∗]_ _, the two smallest solutions of Eq._ (29) _, δ±_ ( _s_ ) _are given by_


            -             _δ_ +( _s_ ) _∈_ (1 _−_ _η_ ) _δ_ 0 [+][(] _[s]_ [)] _[,]_ [ (1 +] _[ η]_ [)] _[δ]_ 0 [+][(] _[s]_ [)] _,_ _and_ (A2)

in _f_ ( _δ_ ), and thus we show that _|f_ ( _δ_ ) _|_ is upper-bounded by some small constant so that
there exists a positive constant _η <_ 0 _._ 5 for which _F_ changes sign within the interval from
(1 _−_ _η_ ) _δ_ 0 _[±]_ [to (1 +] _[ η]_ [)] _[δ]_ 0 _[±]_ [. Demonstrating this would allow us to conclude that the roots of]
Eq. (17) lie within this interval.

Similar inequality conditions can also be obtained by considering _δ_ 0 _[−]_ [. Now observe that]
if we fix _η_ = 0 _._ 1, the first inequality (Eq. (A18)) puts the following constraint on _c_ :
_c ≤_ 0 _._ 022. On the other hand, the inequality in Eq. (A22) leads to the upper bound of
_c ≤_ 0 _._ 034. From this, we conclude that choosing any _c ≤_ 0 _._ 022 suffices in Definition 4.
Note that other choices of _η_, and _c_ are also possible.
Finally, this shows that the roots of _F_ ( _δ_ ) = 0 exist in the intervals


            -             _δ_ +( _s_ ) _∈_ (1 _−_ _η_ ) _δ_ 0 [+][(] _[s]_ [)] _[,]_ [ (1 +] _[ η]_ [)] _[δ]_ 0 [+][(] _[s]_ [)] _,_ and

### B Gap to the right of the avoided crossing: Proof that f ( s ) is monoton- ically decreasing


In Lemma 11, we claimed that the spectral gap of _H_ ( _s_ ) to the right of the avoided crossing
_s_ _[∗]_ is given by _g_ ( _s_ ) _≥_ 2 _β_ ( _s_ )[1 + _f_ ( _s_ )] _[−]_ [1], where the function

is monotonically decreasing in the interval [ _s_ _[∗]_ _,_ 1]. Here we show that this is indeed the
case for _f_ ( _s_ ) via the following lemma:


**Lemma A2.** _For the choice of a, k in Lemma 11, the function f_ ( _s_ ) _is monotonically_
_decreasing in the interval s ∈_ [ _s_ _[∗]_ _,_ 1] _, where s_ _[∗]_ = _A_ 1 _/_ ( _A_ 1 + 1) _._

and appropriate values of _a, k_ will be chosen later.
We will show that for _s ∈_ [ _s_ _[∗]_ _,_ 1], _f_ _[′]_ ( _s_ ) _<_ 0. For this, we express _f_ = _u_
_v_ [so that]

### C Adiabatic Theorem and the running time of AQC

In this section, we shall extend the recent results in [44] to the continuous-time setting,
leading to a rigorous version of the adiabatic theorem while requiring minimal assumptions on _H_ ( _s_ ). These results allow us to obtain the running time for adiabatic quantum
computation involving any Hamiltonian that is twice differentiable such that there exists
some bound on its spectral gap _g_ ( _s_ ). Thus, we are able to apply the general results we
develop here to determine the running time of the AQO problem. However, our results
are more general and much more widely applicable. In this section, we derive the running
time of adiabatic quantum computation for a generic _H_ ( _s_ ) that satisfies the aforementioned conditions. In the next section, we apply the results developed here to obtain the
running time of our algorithm (Theorem 5). We begin by outlining the assumptions on
_H_ ( _s_ ) for the results to hold.


**Definition A3.** _Suppose that for s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1] _, we have a continuous, twice differentiable_
_path of admissible Hamiltonians H_ ( _s_ ) _such that the relevant eigenstate of H_ (0) _(in most_
_cases the ground state) can be prepared. Then, we assume the existence of the following_
_quantities related to the spectrum of H_ ( _s_ ) _:_


_(i) Suppose λ_ 0 : [0 _,_ 1] _�→_ R _is a continuous function such that λ_ 0( _s_ ) _is an eigenvalue of_
_H_ ( _s_ ) _, for all s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1] _._


_(ii) Define a function g_ 0 : [0 _,_ 1] _�→_ [0 _,_ 1] _such that g_ 0( _s_ ) _≥_ _g_ ( _s_ ) _for all s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1] _._


_(iii) The intersection of_ [ _λ_ 0( _s_ ) _−_ _g_ 0( _s_ ) _, λ_ 0( _s_ ) + _g_ 0( _s_ )] _with the spectrum of H_ ( _s_ ) _is exactly_
_{λ_ 0( _s_ ) _}._


_Furthermore, define P_ ( _s_ ) _to be the projector on to the eigenspace associated with the_
_eigenvalue λ_ 0( _s_ ) _, and let Q_ ( _s_ ) = _I −_ _P_ ( _s_ ) _._


Having defined the parametrized Hamiltonian, we can now move on to the derivation
of the rigorous version of the adiabatic theorem. Note that these results are quite general
and require minimal assumptions on _H_ . For our results, we simply assume knowledge of
_g_ 0( _s_ ), which bounds the gap. No detailed knowledge of the gap, the eigenvalue _λ_ 0, or any
other part of the spectrum is required.


C.1 Adiabatic Eigenpath Traversal


Suppose we have a time-dependent Hamiltonian _H_ ( _t_ ). Then the evolution of density
matrix _ρ_ under _H_ ( _t_ ) is given by the Liouville–von Neumann equation, given by


d _ρ_

(A27)
d _t_ [=] _[ −][i]_ [[] _[H, ρ]_ [(] _[t]_ [)]] _[.]_


Now suppose the time depends on some parameter _s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1], i.e. _t_ = _K_ ( _s_ ). Then, by
performing a change of variable, we have a parametrized Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ) such that the
Liouville–von Neumann equation becomes


d _ρ_
(A28)
d _s_ [=] _[ −][iK][′]_ [[] _[H, ρ]_ [(] _[s]_ [)]] _[,]_


where _K_ ( _s_ ) the schedule. Now consider some initial state _ρ_ (0) that has a projection of
_P_ (0) _ρ_ (0) _P_ (0) onto the relevant eigenspace of _H_ (0). As we evolve _ρ_ under _H_ according to


Accepted in 2025-07-03, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 46


the schedule _K_ ( _s_ ), we consider the projection of _ρ_ ( _s_ ) on to the relevant eigenspace throughout the evolution. Ultimately, we are interested in bounding the fidelity, Tr[ _P_ (1) _ρ_ (1)]. In
order to understand why this is related to the adiabatic theorem, consider that the initial state _ρ_ (0) is the ground state of _H_ (0) and _P_ ( _s_ ) is the projection on to the ground
space of _H_ ( _s_ ). Then, Tr[ _P_ (1) _ρ_ (1)] indicates whether the projection of the final state onto
the ground space of _H_ (1) is high. This would indeed be the case if the evolution were
adiabatic, as the system would continue to remain in the ground state throughout the
evolution. As we prove via the following lemma, this leads us towards a rigorous version
of the adiabatic theorem.


**Lemma A4.** _Consider any parametrized Hamiltonian H_ ( _s_ ) _that satisfies Definition A3_
_and let K_ : [0 _,_ 1] _→_ R [+] _be a differentiable function such that the derivative K_ _[′]_ _is absolutely_
_continuous. Then, the evolution of any state ρ under H, according to the schedule K_ ( _s_ )
_satisfies_
_ε_ = 1 _−_ Tr[ _P_ (1) _ρ_ (1)] _,_


_such that_


_ε ≤_ ( _K_ _[′]_ (1)) _[−]_ [1][ ��] �� _P ′_ (1) _,_ ( _H_ (1) _−_ _λ_ 0(1) _· I_ )+� [�] ��

_Proof._ First, observe that


_ε_ = 1 _−_ Tr� _P_ (1) _ρ_ (1)� = Tr� _P_ (0) _ρ_ (0)� _−_ Tr� _P_ (1) _ρ_ (1)� = Tr� _Pρ_ 1
��� ����0 _[.]_


So we track the change in fidelity over time, i.e. Tr� _P_ ( _s_ ) _ρ_ ( _s_ )�. To this end, construct a
differential equation for Tr[ _Pρ_ ] by taking its derivative with respect to _s_, i.e.


Tr[ _Pρ_ ] _[′]_ = Tr[ _P_ _[′]_ _ρ_ ] + Tr[ _Pρ_ _[′]_ ] _._


This can be simplified using the fact that _PP_ _[′]_ _P_ = 0 and _QP_ _[′]_ _Q_ = 0 [1] . This yields,


Tr[ _Pρ_ _[′]_ ] = _−iK_ _[′]_ Tr� _P_ [ _H, ρ_ ( _s_ )]� = _−iK′_ Tr�[ _H, Pρ_ ( _s_ )]� = 0 _._ (A30)


As _HP_ = _λ_ 0 _P_, we have the following two equations


( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ ) _ρP_ = ( _Hρ −_ _ρH_ ) _P_ = [ _H, ρ_ ] _P_ (A31)

_Pρ_ ( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ ) = _P_ ( _ρH −_ _Hρ_ ) = _−P_ [ _H, ρ_ ] _._ (A32)


1We have _P ′_ = ( _PP_ ) _′_ = _P ′P_ + _PP ′_, so _PP ′P_ = 2 _PP ′P_ and _QP ′Q_ = 0.


Accepted in 2025-07-03, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 47


We then obtain


Tr[ _Pρ_ ] _[′]_ = Tr[ _P_ _[′]_ _ρ_ ] + Tr[ _Pρ_ _[′]_ ] (A33)

= Tr[ _P_ _[′]_ _ρ_ ] (A34)

= Tr[ _PP_ _[′]_ _Qρ_ ] + Tr[ _QP_ _[′]_ _Pρ_ ] (A35)

= Tr� _PP_ _[′]_ ( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ ) [+] ( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ ) _ρ_      - + Tr�( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ )( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ ) [+] _P_ _[′]_ _Pρ_      

(A36)

= Tr� _PP_ _[′]_ ( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ ) [+] [ _H, ρ_ ]� _−_ Tr�( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ ) [+] _P_ _[′]_ _P_ [ _H, ρ_ ]� (A37)


= Tr� _P_ _[′]_ ( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ ) [+] [ _H, ρ_ ]� _−_ Tr�( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ ) [+] _P_ _[′]_ [ _H, ρ_ ]� (A38)

= _i_ ( _K_ _[′]_ ) _[−]_ [1] Tr�� _P ′,_ ( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ )+� _ρ′_    - _._ (A40)


Then, solving the differential equation gives

Tr[ _Pρ_ ]��10 [=] _[ i]_    - 1( _K_ _[′]_ ) _[−]_ [1] Tr�� _P ′,_ ( _H −_ _λ_ 0 _· I_ )+� _ρ′_    - d _s_ (A41)

Finally, the error _ε_ can be bounded by bounding the absolute value of these three terms

Notice that for the expression in the RHS of the upper bound on _ε_, there are terms
of the form ( _H_ [+] ) _[′]_ (derivative of the pseudoinverse), for bounded operators _H_, with zero
spectral norm. Formally, we prove the following:


**Lemma A5.** _Let H_ ( _s_ ) _be a path of operators with spectrum σ_ - _H_ ( _s_ )� _such that_ 0 _∈_ _σ_ - _H_ ( _s_ )�

_and_ min �� _σ_ ( _H_ ( _s_ )) _\{_ 0 _}_ �� = _g_ ( _s_ ) _̸_ = 0 _for all s. Furthermore, suppose that PH is the projector_
_on to the ground space of H. Then,_

_Proof._ First, we prove (1). Let Γ be a circle in the complex plane, centered at the ground
energy with radius _g/_ 2. Then we have the Riesz form of the projector

_RH_ ( _z_ ) d _z,_

where _RH_ ( _z_ ) = - _z · I −_ _H_ - _−_ 1 is the resolvent of _H_ at _z_ . Then _RH_ ( _z_ ) _′_ = _RH_ ( _z_ ) _H_ _′RH_ ( _z_ )
(the derivative is with respect to _s_, not _z_ ). As _H_ is a normal operator, the norm _∥RH_ ( _z_ ) _∥_

is equal to the inverse of the distance from _z_ to the spectrum _σ_ ( _H_ ). On the circle Γ this
is equal to ( _g/_ 2) _[−]_ [1] everywhere. We can then approximate

Now, we are in a position to state the adiabatic theorem and obtain a bound on the
running time of adiabatic quantum computing so that the fidelity of the final state with
the ground state is at least 1 _−_ _ε_ . We do so in the next section.


C.2 Scaling the derivative of the schedule with the gap


Recall that adiabatic quantum computation is an interpolation between two Hamiltonians,
_H_ 0 and _HP_, such that the evolution is governed by the time-dependent Hamiltonian
_H_ ( _s_ ) = (1 _−_ _s_ ) _H_ 0 + _sHP_ . The system begins in the ground state of _H_ 0 and evolves slowly
(adiabatically) over a long enough time _T_ such that, by the end of the evolution, the
final state is _ε_ -close to the ground state of _HP_ . The precise meaning of “a long enough
time” _T_ is captured by the rigorous version of the quantum adiabatic theorem. Also, it is
well known that the running time _T_ scales as a polynomial of the inverse gap. However,
the precise scaling depends on the nature of the schedule. Indeed, the overall running is
minimized when the schedule is local, i.e. it takes into account the instantaneous gap of
_H_ ( _s_ ), leading to faster evolution in regions where the gap is large while slowing down when
the gap shrinks. In other words, the derivative of the schedule scales with the spectral
gap _g_ ( _s_ ) of the adiabatic Hamiltonian.
In this section, we use the machinery developed in Sec. C.1 to provide a generic upper
bound on the running time _T_ when such a local schedule is used to perform adiabatic
quantum computation. More precisely, the following theorem shows that adiabatic evolution under a local schedule for a time _T_ results in a final state that has at least 1 _−_ _ε_ with
the target state (for instance, the ground state of the problem Hamiltonian).

_Proof._ Let _ε_ 0 be the actual error of the algorithm, so that we need _ε_ 0 to be upper bounded
by _ε_ . In this case, Eq. (A29) in Lemma A4 becomes

We bound each of these terms separately using Lemma A6. For the first term, we can
make use of (4) from Lemma A6 to obtain:

In the next section, we derive the running time of our AQO algorithm by making use
of this lemma.

### D Proof of Theorem 5

Here, we provide a detailed proof of one of our main results, namely the running time of
the unstructured adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm (Theorem 5). For this, we
borrow the general results obtained in Sec. C. We begin by restating Theorem 5.


**Theorem 5** (Main result 1: Running time of AQO) **.** _Let ε ∈_ [0 _,_ 1) _and consider the_
_adiabatic Hamiltonian_
_H_ ( _s_ ) = _−_ (1 _−_ _s_ ) _|ψ_ 0 _⟩⟨ψ_ 0 _|_ + _sHz,_

_such that |ψ_ 0 _⟩_ = _|_ + _⟩_ _[⊗][n]_ _and Hz satisfies the conditions of Definition 4. Then, adiabatic_
_quantum optimization prepares a quantum state that has a fidelity of at least_ 1 _−_ _ε with an_
_equal superposition of the ground states of Hz, given by_

_._



_Proof._ We use Theorem A7 to obtain _T_ . Note that in our case, _λ_ 0( _s_ ) is the ground state of
the adiabatic Hamiltonian _H_ ( _s_ ). Let us first estimate _B_ 1. Observe that for this, we need
to obtain an upper bound for the integral �01 [d] _[s/g]_ [0][(] _[s]_ [)] _[p]_ [. We use the lower bounds derived]
on the gap _g_ ( _s_ ) in Sec. 2, which, in each of the three regions, can be lower bounded by
_g_ min where

_g_ min =
_A_ 1 + 1



Moreover, in each of the three regions, we obtain linear bounds on the gap _g_ ( _s_ ), which
we shall use to evaluate the aforementioned integral. One important fact from Theorem
A7 is that _g_ 0( _s_ ) needs to be absolutely continuous in the entire interval of _s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1]. We
modify the bounds on _g_ 0( _s_ ) so that it is a continuous function in the entire interval without
affecting the running time of the AQO algorithm. More precisely, it suffices to shrink the
lower bounds on _g_ ( _s_ ) by a factor of

(for _k_ = 1 _/_ 4 defined in Lemma 11) so that _g_ 0( _s_ ) is now lower bounded by _k g_ min for all
_s ∈_ [0 _,_ 1]. We state rescaled bounds _g_ 0( _s_ ) here. For this, recall:

where _a_ = 4 _k_ [2] ∆ _/_ 3. Then, the rescaled lower bound for the gap in each of the intervals is:
