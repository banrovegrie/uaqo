## Abstract

Tighter error bounds when restricting analysis to low-energy subspaces, demonstrating asymptotically more efficient simulation for low-energy states.

## Key Results

### Standard vs Low-Energy Bounds

**Standard bound:**
$$\|U_{\text{PF}}(t) - e^{-iHt}\| \leq \mathcal{O}(\|H\|^{p+1} t^{p+1})$$

**Low-energy bound (this work):**
$$\|(U_{\text{PF}}(t) - e^{-iHt})|\psi_E\rangle\| \leq \mathcal{O}(E^{p+1} t^{p+1})$$

where |ψ_E⟩ has energy bounded by E ≪ ||H||.

### Conditions for Improvement
- **Locality:** Hamiltonian has local/geometrically local terms
- **Positivity:** Individual terms satisfy positivity constraints
- **Low-energy states:** Initial state confined to low-energy subspace

### Key Insight
For extensive systems:
- ||H|| ~ n (scales with system size)
- Low-energy E ~ O(1) or O(n^α) with α < 1

This gap drives the improvement.

### Applications
- Ground state problems
- Quantum chemistry
- VQE and variational methods
- More realistic resource estimates
