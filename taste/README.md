Deep analysis of writing patterns, structural techniques, and actionable guidance for thesis writing.


## Scott Aaronson

**Style essence**: Makes you *feel* why a result matters before showing you the proof. Master of the philosophical hook.

### What Makes His Writing Work

Aaronson writes for intelligent outsiders. His signature move is to take a technical result and show why it matters for questions people already care about. In "Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity," he opens not with definitions but with a Turing quote about the fallacy of logical omniscience, immediately signaling that this will connect to deep questions.

**Structural patterns observed**:
1. **The philosophical hook**: Opens with a question or paradox that the reader already finds interesting
2. **The ground rules**: Explicitly states what the essay will and won't cover (see Section 1.1)
3. **The complexity 101 section**: Brief, accessible primer before diving deep
4. **The "one might think... but" construction**: Anticipates and addresses objections
5. **The concrete example**: Tornado assembling a 747, lookup tables, Borges' Library of Babel
6. **The honest admission**: "I personally see no reason to believe..." shows intellectual honesty

**Paragraph-level techniques**:
- Paragraphs often begin with a provocative claim, then unpack it
- Uses rhetorical questions to guide the reader's thinking
- Employs first person liberally ("I find it surprising that...")
- Footnotes handle technical qualifications without disrupting flow
- Italics for emphasis on key conceptual points

**Sentence-level patterns**:
- Short punchy sentences after long complex ones for rhythm
- Parenthetical asides that add personality ("the other complexity theory, which studies complex systems")
- Explicitly numbered lists when making multiple distinct points

### Actionable Pointers for Thesis

1. **Opening chapters**: Ask "What question does this answer that a physicist would already care about?"
2. **Before every definition**: Write one paragraph explaining why we need this concept
3. **The ground rules trick**: Early in introduction, explicitly list what thesis will/won't cover
4. **Vivid analogies**: For every abstract concept, find one concrete physical analogy
5. **Anticipate objections**: Include "One might worry that..." paragraphs
6. **Honest limitations**: Include explicit "Criticisms of [approach]" subsection
7. **The relevance test**: For each section, write one sentence explaining its philosophical import

## Roger Penrose

**Style essence**: Start from physical reality, build the mathematics as the inevitable language, and use geometry as the main intuition engine.

### What Makes His Writing Work

Penrose typically begins with the conceptual confusion first, not with the formalism. He asks what a physical statement even means, then introduces the minimum mathematics that makes the statement precise. The reader gets a feeling that the math is not decoration: it is the only way to say the thing cleanly.

**Structural patterns to borrow**:
1. **Physical question first**: "What is the world doing?" before "What is the model?"
2. **Geometry as intuition**: Replace algebraic manipulation with a picture whenever possible (state space, energy landscapes, avoided crossings)
3. **Build abstractions only when forced**: Each new definition is justified by a specific failure of the previous language
4. **Long-range signposting**: Remind the reader why a technical detour matters two chapters later
5. **Relentless clarity about assumptions**: Distinguish "postulate", "definition", "approximation", and "idealization"

### Actionable Pointers for This Thesis (AQC/AQO)

1. **Treat schedules as physical control**: Ask what it means to "set s(t)" in an experiment and what precision costs.
2. **Make the spectral gap a shape**: Use a repeated schematic of g(s) with the window around s* to carry the entire technical story.
3. **Use a single running system**: One toy spectrum / two-level avoided crossing picture that reappears in Chapters 4-9.
4. **Connect complexity to physics via precision**: Frame NP/#P hardness as hardness of extracting fine spectral data, not as an abstract oracle game.
5. **End chapters with synthesis**: A short summary that answers the opening physical question in the new language.

### Works (not stored here)

Penrose's relevant expository style is best seen in his books (e.g., The Emperor's New Mind, The Road to Reality). Use them as a tone reference, not as a technical source for AQC.


## Aram Harrow

**Style essence**: Maximum information density with perfect clarity. Every sentence earns its place.

### What Makes His Writing Work

Harrow's HHL paper is a masterclass in technical writing. The abstract alone contains: the problem, the classical baseline, the quantum improvement, and the conditions under which it applies. No wasted words. The paper follows a rigid logical structure that makes it easy to find specific information.

**Structural patterns observed**:
1. **The problem-solution abstract**: Problem statement, classical bound, quantum algorithm, improvement factor
2. **The "sketch then details" pattern**: Section II gives algorithm intuition, Appendix A gives full proofs
3. **The modular proof structure**: Each piece (algorithm, runtime, optimality) is self-contained
4. **The reduction for hardness**: Shows optimality by reducing from BQP-complete problems
5. **The "discussion" section**: Extensions, generalizations, and connections to other work
6. **The explicit error analysis**: Separate subsection devoted entirely to error bounds

**Paragraph-level techniques**:
- Topic sentences that precisely state what the paragraph will establish
- Mathematical statements interspersed naturally with prose
- Equations are part of sentences, not separate entities
- Each paragraph typically makes exactly one point

**Notation discipline**:
- Consistent use of O-tilde notation for suppressing log factors
- Explicit statement of what norms mean (spectral norm for operators)
- Runtime stated with all dependencies explicit: O(log(N) s^2 kappa^2 / epsilon)

### Actionable Pointers for Thesis

1. **State results precisely**: Every theorem should have explicit error bounds and complexity
2. **Separate intuition from proof**: Use "We sketch here the basic idea... we discuss it in more detail in the next section"
3. **Modular structure**: Algorithm description, runtime analysis, optimality proof as distinct sections
4. **Runtime with dependencies**: Always state T = O(f(n, epsilon, kappa, ...)) with all parameters
5. **The "Related work" paragraph**: Brief, precise comparison to prior results
6. **The "Discussion" section**: Extensions, limitations, open questions
7. **Hardness via reduction**: If claiming something is hard, prove it by reduction

## Ronald de Wolf

**Style essence**: The patient teacher who never loses you. Sustains narrative across hundreds of pages.

### What Makes His Writing Work

De Wolf's PhD thesis is perhaps the best model for thesis writing. It opens with a philosophical epigraph ("Se non e vero, e ben trovato" - even if it's not true, it's a nice idea), immediately establishing a personal, reflective voice. The acknowledgments read like a story of intellectual development, not a list of names.

**Structural patterns observed**:
1. **The philosophical epigraph**: Sets tone before content begins
2. **The acknowledgments as narrative**: Thanks people for specific intellectual contributions
3. **The roadmap introduction**: Chapter 1 is itself a mini-survey of the field
4. **The motivation-definition-theorem-discussion cycle**: Each concept introduced this way
5. **The running examples**: OR, PARITY, MAJORITY appear throughout
6. **The chapter summary**: Each chapter ends with "Summary" consolidating key insights
7. **The linear algebra appendix**: Technical preliminaries in appendix, not main text

**Chapter-level architecture** (from Chapter 2):
- 2.1 Introduction: Why this chapter matters, what we'll prove
- 2.2 Boolean Functions and Polynomials: Building blocks, carefully motivated
- 2.3 Query Complexity: The models we need
- 2.4-2.7: Main results, organized by function class
- 2.8 Summary: What we learned, what's next

**The "two-pass" exposition**:
- First pass: Informal explanation in plain language
- Second pass: Formal definition/theorem/proof
- Example: "Roughly, by a 'classical' state we mean a state in which the system can be found if we observe it." Then formal definition follows.

**Transition techniques**:
- "Before continuing with the harder case, notice the resemblance..."
- "The point of these examples was to illustrate that..."
- "An important property that deserves to be mentioned is..."

### Actionable Pointers for Thesis

1. **Philosophical opening**: Begin with an epigraph or philosophical framing
2. **Acknowledgments as narrative**: Write about intellectual journey, not just names
3. **Chapter 1 as mini-survey**: Introduction should be readable as standalone overview
4. **The two-pass pattern**: Informal intuition, then formal statement
5. **Running examples**: Choose 2-3 examples (functions, Hamiltonians) and use throughout
6. **Chapter summaries**: End every chapter with "Summary" section
7. **Appendix for background**: Put linear algebra, complexity definitions in appendix
8. **Historical context**: Weave in who proved what when ("Bernstein and Vazirani also defined...")
9. **The "helpful comparison" paragraph**: "At this point, a comparison with [X] may be helpful."

### De Wolf vs Zeeshan Thesis: Detailed Comparison

| Aspect | De Wolf | Zeeshan (baseline) |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **Opening** | Philosophical epigraph: "Se non e vero, e ben trovato" (Even if it's not true, it's a nice idea) sets reflective, honest tone | Standard certificate page followed by Turing quote about intelligent computers |
| **Abstract** | Structured, separated from main text, brief summary in "Samenvatting" and English "Abstract" at end | Single dense paragraph (500+ words) frontloading all results without breathing room |
| **Acknowledgments** | Narrative of intellectual development: thanks Harry Buhrman for "creative and interminable source of interesting problems", names specific contributions from each collaborator | Lists names with generic gratitude: "I would like to thank", "His support...will not go unnoticed" |
| **Chapter structure** | Each chapter has Introduction explaining why it matters, then content, then Summary consolidating insights | Chapters lack internal summaries; transitions are implicit rather than explicit |
| **Motivation before definition** | "Roughly, by a 'classical' state we mean a state in which the system can be found if we observe it" precedes formal definition | Definitions appear with less intuitive buildup: "The state of an isolated quantum system is described by a unit vector" |
| **Two-pass exposition** | Consistent pattern: informal explanation, then formal theorem. E.g., explains quantum states intuitively before Hilbert space formalism | Single-pass: formal definitions with explanatory text interwoven but not separated |
| **Running examples** | OR, PARITY, MAJORITY appear throughout all chapters, building familiarity | Ising model and methane serve as examples but less systematically threaded |
| **Transitions** | Explicit: "At this point, a comparison with classical probability distributions may be helpful", "An important property that deserves to be mentioned is entanglement" | Implicit: relies on section structure rather than prose bridges |
| **Historical context** | Weaves attribution naturally: "This was proven independently at around the same time by Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann, and Sipser" | Citations present but less narrative integration: "[20], [21], [22]" style |
| **Chapter summaries** | Every chapter ends with "Summary" section restating key results informally and connecting to thesis arc | No chapter summaries; chapters end where content ends |
| **Voice** | Personal and honest: "Even if the theory of quantum computing never materializes...it is still an extremely interesting idea" | Technical and neutral: avoids personal voice, focuses on results |
| **Theoretical depth** | Deep original contributions: polynomial method, query complexity bounds, communication complexity lower bounds | Primarily benchmarking and numerical results; theoretical content is survey-like |
| **Appendix usage** | Linear algebra background in Appendix A, keeping main text focused on ideas | Background material in Chapter 2, competing with main results for attention |
| **Scope** | PhD thesis: 200+ pages, multiple original research papers, broad theoretical contribution | MS thesis: 69 pages, focused application of existing methods to specific problems |

## Shantanav Chakraborty

**Style essence**: Modern quantum algorithms paper with rigorous complexity-theoretic framing.

### What Makes His Writing Work

The AQO paper (2411.05736) is directly relevant to the thesis topic. It demonstrates how to write about adiabatic quantum computation with proper complexity-theoretic care. The structure is: problem statement, main results, technical development, hardness results, discussion.

**Structural patterns observed**:
1. **The "Contents" as roadmap**: Detailed table of contents showing logical flow
2. **The "Preliminaries" section**: Defines complexity classes, notation, key concepts
3. **The "Summary of results" subsection**: States main theorems upfront in Section 1.2
4. **The "Related Work" subsection**: Explicit comparison to prior art
5. **The main result theorem boxes**: Key results in named, numbered theorems
6. **The "Discussion" section**: Limitations, open questions, philosophical implications
7. **The appendix structure**: Technical proofs separated from main narrative

**Mathematical writing patterns**:
- Complexity-theoretic notation explained: "g(n) = O(f(n)) implies g is upper bounded by f"
- Norm conventions stated explicitly: "||A|| will denote the spectral norm"
- Named definitions: "Definition 4 (The problem Hamiltonian)"
- Lemmas support theorems: Lemma 3 (Adiabatic Theorem) enables Theorem 5

**Figure usage**:
- Figure 1: Spectrum visualization with inset for detail
- Figure 2: Schematic of proof technique
- Figure 3: Comparison of actual gap vs. lower bounds

### Domain-Specific Conventions for AQO

1. **Hamiltonian notation**: H(s) = (1-s)H_0 + sH_P with s as schedule
2. **Spectral parameters**: Gap g(s), avoided crossing position s*, window delta_s
3. **Complexity classes**: NP, #P with formal definitions
4. **Runtime statements**: T = O(2^{n/2} poly(n)) with explicit polynomial factors
5. **Error analysis**: Trace distance, fidelity, epsilon-closeness
6. **Adiabatic theorem**: Cite the standard formulation (Jansen et al., Ambainis-Regev)

### Actionable Pointers for Thesis

1. **Preliminaries section**: Define notation, complexity classes, key concepts
2. **Summary of results early**: State main theorems in introduction before proofs
3. **Named definitions**: Use "Definition X (Descriptive Name)" format
4. **Related work**: Explicit subsection comparing to prior art
5. **Figures for spectra**: Visualize eigenvalue structure with avoided crossings
6. **Hardness results**: If claiming optimality, prove hardness via reduction
7. **Discussion section**: Address limitations, open problems, implications
8. **Appendix for proofs**: Keep main text focused on results and intuition

## Synthesis: Principles for Thesis Writing

The patterns below should be internalized and embodied, not signaled. The reader should never see the scaffolding. Writing "from a philosophical standpoint" or "the key insight here is" reveals technique rather than executing it. Good craft is invisible.

What the authors above share: they make the reader care about a question before answering it. They state results with precision and acknowledge limitations honestly. They guide the reader through unfamiliar territory with patience, building intuition through examples that recur and accumulate meaning. The goal is a thesis where each idea arrives exactly when needed, where definitions feel necessary before they appear, where the reader finishes with new perspective rather than just new facts.

### Structural Blueprint for Chapters

Based on de Wolf's thesis structure combined with modern conventions:

```
Chapter N: [Title]

N.1 Introduction
    - Why this chapter matters
    - What we will prove
    - Connection to previous chapters

N.2 Preliminaries (if needed)
    - Definitions specific to this chapter
    - Notation conventions

N.3-N.k Main Content
    - Each section: motivation -> definition -> result -> discussion
    - Running examples throughout
    - Figures for complex structures

N.(k+1) Summary
    - Key results stated informally
    - Connections to broader themes
    - Preview of next chapter
```

### The 15 Commandments of Good Technical Writing

**On Motivation**:
1. Never introduce a concept without first explaining why we need it
2. Every chapter should answer a question the reader already cares about
3. The abstract/introduction should make a physicist want to read more

**On Structure**:
4. State main results early; proofs can come later
5. Use the two-pass pattern: intuition first, formalism second
6. End every chapter with a summary that ties to larger themes

**On Precision**:
7. Every theorem should have explicit error bounds and complexity
8. Define notation when introduced, not in a front-loaded section
9. State clearly what results do and don't achieve

**On Examples**:
10. Choose 2-3 running examples and use them throughout
11. For every abstract concept, provide at least one concrete instance
12. Use figures to visualize spectra, algorithms, proof structures

**On Connection**:
13. Explicitly compare your work to prior results
14. Acknowledge intellectual debts generously and specifically
15. Include a discussion of open questions and limitations

### Writing Checklist for Each Section

Before finalizing any section, ask:

- [ ] Does the opening paragraph explain why this section matters?
- [ ] Are all definitions motivated before being stated?
- [ ] Is there at least one concrete example?
- [ ] Are all theorems stated with precise bounds?
- [ ] Is there a transition to the next section?
- [ ] Would a graduate student understand the main point on first read?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged relevant prior work?
- [ ] Does this connect to the thesis's larger narrative?

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **The definition dump**: Opening with pages of notation before any motivation
2. **The orphan concept**: Introducing something that's never used again
3. **The vague claim**: "This is efficient" without stating O(f(n))
4. **The missing context**: Proving something without explaining why we care
5. **The abrupt ending**: Finishing a section without summary or transition
6. **The assumed background**: Using terms without definition or reference
7. **The citation-free claim**: Making strong statements without supporting references
8. **The emotional hedge**: "We believe that..." instead of stating precisely what's proven
